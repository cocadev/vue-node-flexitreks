Your comfortable barge carries you gently along the waterways of this culturally rich region, dropping you off at various points along the way to enjoy relaxing rides through ever-changing scenery.</strong></p><p><strong>The </strong><em>Magnifique</em> has long been recognised as one of the most luxurious barges afloat on Dutch waterways and in 2016 she was joined by her equally fabulous sister ship, <em>Magnifique II, </em>offering the same levels of style and space. In 2018 the <em>Magnifique III</em> joined the fleet and certainly upholds the high standards set by her sister-ships.</p><p>The daily cycle routes are varied and interesting with each day bringing something different – one day it could be a serene river-bank ride past small villages and open countryside, the next an exploratory ride through a beautiful and historic city.</p><p>You can opt to accompany the bikes guides each day or use the maps and route notes available on board to navigate yourself.</p><p>The 19 windmills at Kinderdijk are always a popular highlight as are the delightful cities of Ghent and Bruges. Tranquil rides alongside the Vecht and Lek rivers will live long in the memory as will the picturesque ride out to the North Sea Coast from Bruges.</p><p>This leisurely cycle route follows mostly level terrain along dedicated cycle paths.

It's also worth mentioning that e-bikes are a po;ular option on this highly enjoyable cycling holiday.</p>","tour_code":"014-101CAT","status":"live","operator_id":1,"gallery_id":57,"media_id":539,"nights":[6,7],"slug":"austrian-lakes-cycling-holiday","related_tours":null,"guidance":0,"difficulty":["Leisurely"],"length":"272","months":"April - October","highlights":null,"bike_and_boat":false,"balance_due":70,"rating":"4.83","deleted":false,"solo_cyclists_allowed":true,"destinations":[{"id":3,"name":"Austria","currency":"Euro","tipping":"","slug":"cycling-holidays-austria"}],"image":{"id":539,"url":"https://flexitreks.imgix.net/images/2015/08/25/Hallstatt-Salzkammergut-Austria.jpg","alt":"Hallstatt on Lake Hallstatt in the Salzkammergut","caption":"Hallstatt on Lake Hallstatt - Salzkammergut","credit":null,"title":null}},"rooms":[{"id":71,"tour_price_id":5214,"cost":1056,"net":872,"name":"Double","sleeps":2,"category":"Comfort","tour_price":{"id":5214,"createdAt":"2019-03-05T16:12:14.346Z","cost":528,"tour_id":74,"tour_pricing_category_id":928,"room_type_id":1,"accommodation_category_id":1,"deck_id":null,"tour_season_id":181,"formula":"545","gross":545,"non_com":0,"net":436,"adjustment":0,"markup_rate_id":51},"extras":[]}],"party":[{"id":124,"createdAt":"2019-03-06T14:35:25.403Z","title":"Mr","first_name":"jkhg","last_name":"kjhg","date_of_birth":"1971-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","height":180,"dietary_requirements":null,"booking_id":66,"booking_room_id":71,"tour_bike_id":457,"tour_bike":{"id":457,"bike_id":2,"name":"Bike with pannier & lock","short_name":"Regular bike","content":null,"bike_gallery_id":1,"tour_bike_gallery_id":null,"cost":76,"boat_id":null,"nights":0,"tour_season_id":181,"order":1},"extras":[{"id":23,"party_member_id":124,"tour_party_extra_variation_id":351,"cost":141,"net":139,"name":"Half board 6 nights","variation":{"id":351,"createdAt":"2019-03-06T09:17:25.803Z","tour_party_extra_id":268,"cost":141,"accommodation_category_id":1,"bike_id":null,"min_pax":null,"max_pax":null,"formula":"139","gross":139,"non_com":0,"net":139,"adjustment":0,"markup_rate_id":55}}]},{"id":125,"createdAt":"2019-03-06T14:35:25.403Z","title":"Mrs","first_name":"kjhg","last_name":",jhg","date_of_birth":"1981-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","height":170,"dietary_requirements":null,"booking_id":66,"booking_room_id":71,"tour_bike_id":457,"tour_bike":{"id":457,"bike_id":2,"name":"Bike with pannier & lock","short_name":"Regular bike","content":null,"bike_gallery_id":1,"tour_bike_gallery_id":null,"cost":76,"boat_id":null,"nights":0,"tour_season_id":181,"order":1},"extras":[{"id":24,"party_member_id":125,"tour_party_extra_variation_id":351,"cost":141,"net":139,"name":"Half board 6 nights","variation":{"id":351,"createdAt":"2019-03-06T09:17:25.803Z","tour_party_extra_id":268,"cost":141,"accommodation_category_id":1,"bike_id":null,"min_pax":null,"max_pax":null,"formula":"139","gross":139,"non_com":0,"net":139,"adjustment":0,"markup_rate_id":55}}]}],"payments":[]}

Starting from the head of the Resia Pass, close to the Austrian border, this idyllic cycle path follows the Adige River as it descends through stunning alpine landscapes past quaint mountain villages and historic towns to Lake Garda.</p><p>If you're looking for carefree, easy cycling on quiet cycle paths through jaw-dropping scenery then look no further - the Adige River and Lake Garda Cycling Holiday really should be on your leisure cycling bucket list.</p><p>The route starts high in the Italian Alps at the head of the Resia/Reschen Pass and follows the Adige River as it descends along the stunning Venosta Valley. You'll be cycling on a traffic free, tarmac cycle path. The going is easy, being predominantly downhill, allowing plenty of time to drink in the panoramic alpine vistas that unfold all around.</p><p><img src=\\"https://flexitreks.imgix.net/images/2017/01/25/Adige-Cycle-path-I-F.jpeg?w=800\\" /></p><p>You'll cycle past small villages and medieval towns, some of which originate from Roman times as this is the route of the <em>Via Claudia Augusta</em>, a trans-alpine path first opened in 46 AD. As you descend, the fruit orchards begin to give way to vineyards and the Adige turns from a tumbling mountain stream to a fully fledged river.</p><p>Shortly after the town of Trento you face the one, short, easy climb of the route - don't worry it's not that long and there's no penalty for walking or taking a breather. Your efforts are rewarded with an exhilarating descent to the stunning northern shore of Lake Garda. If you opt for the 6 night version, then you'll spend the last night of your tour in one of the pretty lakeside towns on the northern shore, such as Riva, Torbole or Nago. If you opt for the 7 night version then you will enjoy a ferry ride down to the lake's southern shore and spend the night in the charming village of Peschiera. On your last day of cycling you can choose whether to cycle to the historic city of Verona, with its Roman Amphitheatre, or the Renaissance city of Mantova - both are brimming with history and make fitting finales to this fabulous cycling adventure.</p><p>The vast majority of this route is on tarmac cycle paths with some very short stretches on quiet roads. The route is predominantly downhill or level making it a good choice for families and anyone with a basic level of fitness. It's also possible to shorten each ride with train rides ( except day 7).</p>","tour_code":"019-120CIT","status":"live","operator_id":4,"gallery_id":151,"media_id":2173,"nights":[6,7],"slug":"adige-river-lake-garda-cycling-holiday","related_tours":[],"guidance":0,"difficulty":["Easy","Leisurely"],"length":"275","months":"April - October","highlights":"<ul><li>E-bikes available</li><li>Cycle path heaven</li><li>Easy cycling - suitable for families</li><li>Superb alpine scenery</li><li>See stunning Lake Garda</li><li>6 and 7 night options</li></ul>","bike_and_boat":false,"balance_due":70,"rating":"4.83","deleted":false,"solo_cyclists_allowed":true,"destinations":[{"id":1,"name":"Italy","currency":"Euro","tipping":"<p>People no longer expect to be tipped as a matter of course, but hardworking and courteous staff are pleased if you round up the bill.

Starting from the head of the Resia Pass, close to the Austrian border, this idyllic cycle path follows the Adige River as it descends through stunning alpine landscapes past quaint mountain villages and historic towns to Lake Garda.</p><p>{{ youtube ACX-hP9wEZc }}</p><p>If you're looking for carefree, easy cycling on quiet cycle paths through jaw-dropping scenery then look no further - the Adige River and Lake Garda Cycling Holiday really should be on your leisure cycling bucket list.</p><p>The route starts high in the Italian Alps at the head of the Resia/Reschen Pass and follows the Adige River as it descends along the stunning Venosta Valley. You'll be cycling on a traffic free, tarmac cycle path. The going is easy, being predominantly downhill, allowing plenty of time to drink in the panoramic alpine vistas that unfold all around.</p><p>You'll cycle past small villages and medieval towns, some of which originate from Roman times as this is the route of the <em>Via Claudia Augusta</em>, a trans-alpine path first opened in 46 AD. As you descend, the fruit orchards begin to give way to vineyards and the Adige turns from a tumbling mountain stream to a fully fledged river.</p><p>Shortly after the town of Trento you face the one, short, easy climb of the route - don't worry it's not that long and there's no penalty for walking or taking a breather. Your efforts are rewarded with an exhilarating descent to the stunning northern shore of Lake Garda. If you opt for the 6 night version, then you'll spend the last night of your tour in one of the pretty lakeside towns on the northern shore, such as Riva, Torbole or Nago. If you opt for the 7 night version then you will enjoy a ferry ride down to the lake's southern shore and spend the night in the charming village of Peschiera. On your last day of cycling you can choose whether to cycle to the historic city of Verona, with its Roman Amphitheatre, or the Renaissance city of Mantova - both are brimming with history and make fitting finales to this fabulous cycling adventure.</p><p>The vast majority of this route is on tarmac cycle paths with some very short stretches on quiet roads. The route is predominantly downhill or level making it a good choice for families and anyone with a basic level of fitness. It's also possible to shorten each ride with train rides ( except day 7).</p>","tour_code":"019-120CIT","status":"live","operator_id":4,"gallery_id":151,"media_id":2173,"nights":[6,7],"slug":"adige-river-lake-garda-cycling-holiday","related_tours":[],"guidance":0,"difficulty":["Easy","Leisurely"],"length":"275","months":"April - October","highlights":"<ul><li>E-bikes available</li><li>Cycle path heaven</li><li>Easy cycling - suitable for families</li><li>Superb alpine scenery</li><li>See stunning Lake Garda</li><li>6 and 7 night options</li></ul>","bike_and_boat":false,"balance_due":10,"rating":"4.83","deleted":false,"solo_cyclists_allowed":true,"start_point":"Bolzano","finish_point":"Riva,Torbole,Verona","arrival_days":"Sat, Sun, Wed","destinations":[{"id":3,"name":"Austria","currency":"Euro","tipping":"","slug":"cycling-holidays-austria"}],"image":{"id":2173,"url":"https://flexitreks.imgix.net/images/2017/01/25/Adige-Cycle-Path-F.jpeg","alt":"Adige Cycle Path","caption":"Adige Cycle Path","credit":null,"title":null}},"rooms":[{"id":77,"tour_price_id":5794,"cost":1408,"net":1164,"name":"Double","sleeps":2,"category":"Superior","tour_price":{"id":5794,"createdAt":"2019-04-23T10:43:46.035Z","cost":704,"tour_id":167,"tour_pricing_category_id":1029,"room_type_id":1,"accommodation_category_id":2,"deck_id":null,"tour_season_id":177,"formula":"590+110","gross":700,"non_com":110,"net":582,"adjustment":0,"markup_rate_id":51},"extras":[]},{"id":78,"tour_price_id":5795,"cost":1408,"net":1164,"name":"Twin","sleeps":2,"category":"Superior","tour_price":{"id":5795,"createdAt":"2019-04-23T10:43:46.035Z","cost":704,"tour_id":167,"tour_pricing_category_id":1029,"room_type_id":2,"accommodation_category_id":2,"deck_id":null,"tour_season_id":177,"formula":"590+110","gross":700,"non_com":110,"net":582,"adjustment":0,"markup_rate_id":51},"extras":[]}],"party":[{"id":136,"createdAt":"2019-07-09T14:47:22.441Z","title":"Miss","first_name":"sdfg","last_name":"sd","date_of_birth":"1966-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","height":152,"dietary_requirements":null,"booking_id":70,"booking_room_id":77,"tour_bike_id":451,"tour_bike":{"id":451,"bike_id":2,"name":"Bike with pannier & lock","short_name":"Regular bike","content":null,"bike_gallery_id":1,"tour_bike_gallery_id":185,"cost":65,"boat_id":null,"nights":6,"tour_season_id":177,"order":1},"extras":[]},{"id":137,"createdAt":"2019-07-09T14:47:22.441Z","title":"Mrs","first_name":"asdf","last_name":"asdf","date_of_birth":"1969-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","height":122,"dietary_requirements":null,"booking_id":70,"booking_room_id":77,"tour_bike_id":452,"tour_bike":{"id":452,"bike_id":1,"name":"Electric bike with pannier & lock","short_name":"eBike","content":"<p>Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium.</p>","bike_gallery_id":1,"tour_bike_gallery_id":null,"cost":154,"boat_id":null,"nights":6,"tour_season_id":177,"order":2},"extras":[]},{"id":138,"createdAt":"2019-07-09T14:47:22.449Z","title":"Ms","first_name":"xcv","last_name":"xcv","date_of_birth":"1958-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","height":183,"dietary_requirements":null,"booking_id":70,"booking_room_id":78,"tour_bike_id":null,"tour_bike":null,"extras":[]},{"id":139,"createdAt":"2019-07-09T14:47:22.450Z","title":"Dr","first_name":"nv","last_name":"li","date_of_birth":"1974-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","height":152,"dietary_requirements":null,"booking_id":70,"booking_room_id":78,"tour_bike_id":451,"tour_bike":{"id":451,"bike_id":2,"name":"Bike with pannier & lock","short_name":"Regular bike","content":null,"bike_gallery_id":1,"tour_bike_gallery_id":185,"cost":65,"boat_id":null,"nights":6,"tour_season_id":177,"order":1},"extras":[]}],"payments":[]}

360	2019-02-19 11:19:26.688378+00	125	2018-04-10 06:11:36.918	Christine Bainbridge	The information was pretty good, however a couple of negative points.  Firstly we did not need to take cycling helmets or water bottles as we were told - they were provided.  This makes a huge difference when only taking very limited cabin baggage on the plane as the helmet is particularly bulky. We were requested to take ‘soft’ luggage to fit under beds.  Again that was not necessary as there was plenty of space so I ended up having to carry a heavy bag on my shoulder.  There were more options for public transport to the boat which were not stated on the paperwork.  This resulted in us having to walk some distance to find the ‘north’ side of the railway station when we could have taken tram number 26 from the south side.  It was not clear that you cannot pay the driver in cash, which is normal in most places in the UK.  Small things but they made a difference to our trip.  Other than that the information was very good.	Fabulous ship, wonderful crew.  Food was fantastic, well presented and the bar bill at the end of the week reasonable.  Couldn’t fault the quality which was superb in every way.  Shame we weren’t offered the use of the jacuzzi on the top deck!  Didn’t know it was there until the last day.	So glad you enjoyed the experience aboard the Magnifique Christine.<br /><br />Thanks very much for the very useful feedback Christine, we have amended our pre-tour advice for this tour accordingly.	4	5	4.50	5acc5598498e8885e150ac81	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5abcc819498e210a8aee55b8/customer-review-generally-positive-a-few-things-could-be-improved

They provided the information we needed and resent it when we managed to lose it.	Very nice tour.  The bikes were new, service was good and the meals were very well done.  The farm is in a lovely and comfortable rural setting.  Staff were friendly and helpful.	Thanks Chip, we're glad you both had a good time and enjoyed your stay in Alentejo.

No worries about being picked up at the bus terminal once we announced when and where we would arrive	It would have been except for the weather, which no one has control over, The only problem we really had was a day scheduled to see a cork manufacturing plant, a knife making company, and a winery, all of which were closed n the day we were scheduled to see them	Many thanks for the feedback Jeffrey.

The accommodation on board was very good and the food magnificent. All staff were very helpful and friendly. One of us had limited cycling experience but found the trip highly enjoyable and not too difficult. The route included many wonderful places, some well known and others very much off the beaten track.	Thanks for the lovely review of this very popular trip Karen. I was lucky enough to do the trip last year and agree with all your comments, particularly the one about the food - delicious!<br /><br />Thanks Karen, we really appreciate your review.	5	5	5.00	5ad6657f498eabd56c9ff94f	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5abcc819498e210a8aee5582/customer-review-

The bikes were excellent but the maps provided were of such poor quality as to be of no assistance in enabling us to confirm that we were on the right path, or to help us in navigating off the route to take in additional sites. The maps were so poor that we resorted to navigating our route on our phone. Unless we were assured of better quality guidance in future we would not use or recommend Dutch Bike Tours	I'm sorry you felt let down by the maps on this tour Robert. We've listened and now offer GPX navigation files for most of our tours (this one included). These files can be uploaded to a GPS enabled smartphone and provide a detailed and highly accurate means of navigation. They can also be used offline so users don't use any of their data allowance.	5	2	3.50	5ae8d2b8e4b00e468b0be1fe	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5abcc819498e210a8aee55b4/customer-review-easy-and-efficient

The food photo on Flexitreks was nothing like the food on the boat. It was one meal for dinner, not a buffet as expected. Pretty basic meals ie spaghetti Bol one night, stew and chips another. Cabin rooms are v compact as described, we found it easier to just have one in room expect at bedtime and you had to sit sideways on loo or have door open. However it was cheaper than a lot of other similar breaks. Just think ‘camping’<br /><br />Cycle part was great due to scenery and Rosanne the guide was excellent and knowledgeable.	Thanks for the useful feedback and we're glad you enjoyed your holiday overall. These canal barges are all quite narrow and there's no escaping the fact the cabins are a little compact. The barge owner assures us he does do buffets sometimes but as this isn't every week we have elected to remove the buffet image from the gallery of this tour.<br />Thank you - It's always nice to hear you would travel with us again	4	4	4.00	5aeb7619e4b068fd9eacaf82	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5abcc819498e210a8aee55a4/customer-review-barge-and-bike-around-the-tulip-fields-of-holland

She went out of her way to help us with the bikes.	This bike and boat tour was a revelation.  We had a wonderful cruise around the Greek islands, we had a wonderful cycling holiday including swim stops at great beaches and crystal clear waters.  And we had some of the best meals and drinks I've had for a long time.  All the crew were wonderful and worked hard to make us comfortable.  We were able to use e-bikes and I would recommend them unless you are really keen and love a cycling challenge.  Four us, the hills would have been to difficult without them.  As it was, we loved every minute of the cycling experience.

It is possible to take a boat on parts of it.  The 27 gear bikes were very good and it is 95% on dedicated cycle paths, completely separate from the road.  The UK has nothing like it.But neither does it have suitable rivers with former tow paths, now cycle paths.	So glad you enjoyed it so much.

Nothing was too mich trouble. I will certainly book through  flexitreks again.	Fabulous holiday. Really enjoyed ourselves. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The farnhouse was fabulous.<br /><br />A couple of teething problems with the cycling directions/ maps were a bit misleading at times but fortunately could see our destination but missed a couple of the things to see. Gave feedback to staff who apologised as they realised there had been mistakes on the map directions and sorted them straight away.<br /><br />Also there was a problem with the meal we had booked with the farmhouse on the last night and we ended up having to have a Take out  pizza service as there was no catering staff available. The staff were full of apologies and organised the food to be delivered but we were all slightly disappointed.<br /><br />May we suggest that maybe a member of staff could clarify every morning or evening what our plans are for dinner either that day or the following day so there can be no misunderstandings as  the Farmhouse is far away from restaurants and shops.<br /><br />Overal though we all had a great time and loved the farmouse and the cycling.<br /><br />I would also like to thank the staff for letting us arrive at the farmhouse early and also invited us to help ourselves to a buffet they had done for some previous customers.

Flexi-treks chose a good local service provider who had good bikes in new or like-new condition.  No water bottle holder, but that seemed typical off all the other tour bikes, too. Route is easy to follow and pretty interesting, popular but not over-crowded in May. Ride is almost entirely flat.  Saar is industrial and less touristic, Moselle is picturesque and more popular.  Most hotels were 2-Star, regardless of their claimed rating, and had no air conditioning or even fans- and it was hot and humid this year! Would have liked a few more food recommendations per stop.  On our tour one night was in a different town than the written plan, probably due to high occupancy in Cochem- our group was disappointed, but it worked out well due to enjoyable family restaurant nearby. Highly recommend reading the entire guide at the beginning, rather than just a day ahead like we did.	Thanks for the informative and useful feedback. Most leisure-bike rental companies elect to not to include a water bottle holder as experience suggests that accidents are more likely to occur whilst reaching for or replacing the water bottle whilst riding. Also, we tend to shy away from food recommendations as restaurants can change from year to year so what was great last year may not be so good this year.<br />Excellent, just what we like to hear!	4	4	4.00	5b164522e4b04fa83c449300	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5b0018f5e4b0266be95baf9e/customer-review-great-route-good-bikes-most-hotels-no-ac

But that was fixed quickly following a telephone call. All pre-arrangements were handled with the usual smoothness.	We have done four trips in the Alps with Flexitreks and this was the best of them all. Some comments for future improvements.  1. The hotel in Salzburg put us in an Annex 150 yards down the road. This was not what we were expecting. 2. The bikes on the first day were mis-labelled so we thought we had been supplied the wrong bikes for 12 hours. This was fixed on the first morning.  After this the tour went very smoothly. Bad Gastein and Kranjska Gora were simply stunning. There are several days with big inclines so electric bikes made the tour far more enjoyable. I would recommended this trip very highly.	Many thanks for the constructive review. We agree that unless you are super-fit e-bikes are worth considering for this scenic but reasonably hilly route.<br /><br />Glad we were able to sort this and deliver your tour details.	5	5	5.00	5b2d22bbe4b0eefa8d409bf1	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5b0018f5e4b0266be95bb075/customer-review-

They confirmed bookings and hotels and notified us when payments were due.  They also provided the GPS in advance of the holiday.	A very enjoyable cycle tour of the Black Forest although weather was not the best but having full set of waterproofs made sure we kept dry for the 2 inclement days. The hotels selected were of a good to very good standard and this included the breakfasts. It should be noted that most places require eating out as the Hotels either didn't have a restaurant or it was closed on the night of our visit but there was always a choice of places in each location. Note that Basel is very expensive so budget a minimum of £25 per head for one course and a drink ,or £40-50 for 2 course and a drink.  The bikes provided were excellent for the type of cycling but getting the bikes on the Swiss train was challenging and if you had more then 2 bikes then you would need to split between a number of carriages. If you had a trailer for a baby then I believe you would have issues given space and the need to lift the bikes up the steps into the train.<br /><br />The documentation for the journey was at best fair but lacked details or the level of detailed maps. I had the GPS file which was invaluable and had to be used  to prevent any major mistakes which would happen if reliant solely on the documents and maps provided. To use the GPS file you need an App and I used Cyclemeter which worked very well and only costs a few pounds. Other apps are available but Cyclemeter seems to be the most recommended one and works with both Google and Apple Maps but I found google maps the best. The GPS worked well until you leave Basel and at that point it was a challenge given it has alternative routes on it and this can lead to confusion and some incorrect turns to new and unexpected destinations!!! Might be worthwhile providing separate GPS files for the alternative routes.<br /><br />The cycling is very easy with few hills and mainly flat or down hill. The cycle paths are also very good and good signage on most but you need to keep you eyes open  as a few signs are easy to miss.  If you are allocated Hotel Neuenfels  in Badenweiler this is not on the GPS and the signage/documentation is poor but a combination of Apps and maps you will find the place. - be prepared for a long climb but once you are there then the place/views are amazing and the hotel is of a very good standard.<br /><br />If you fly into Basel, rather then get a shuttle bus to Basel train station and then a train to Freiburg, there is a bus than runs from outside the French side of the airport directly to Freiburg and this cost 43 euros return per person. Note, you can buy tickets online or if purchased on the bus, it's cash only.<br /><br />Overall a very good holiday with good cycling routes and the chance to see the less touristy parts of the Black Forest.	Thanks for the helpful and thorough feedback. We recommend using the Ride-With-GPS app as our GPX files can be used offline on this app saving valuable data allowance.<br />Many thanks for the great review. GPX files are now available for most of our tours and are a great way of navigating, particularly if you bring along a handlebar-mount for your smartphone.	5	4	4.50	5b0d7be9e4b076c8d877f7df	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5b0018f4e4b0266be95baf5b/customer-review-black-forest-cycling-holiday-2018

Well organised trip.<br /><br />Luggage always collected and generally at destination before 5.30<br /><br />Some of the superior hotels not in the greatest locations but this was probably due to needing space for bikes.  Whether smaller boutique hotels could be used.<br /><br />Should guarantee that will come if a puncture as we had a puncture and the repair kit was not that great- the glue had run out.  For 2 bikes, 2 inner tubes should be included.<br /><br />However maps and directions were excellent and it was really good fun despite bad weather the first 3 days!	Thanks for the very useful review and we're glad you enjoyed it overall. You are right that the hotel choices are sometimes limited by the need for good and secure bike storage.

However, the plastic envelope which was provided to carry/display the Road Book whilst cycling was very poor - it didn't hang from the handle bars properly and the sharp edges meant I could not stand and cycle as the plastic envelope was cutting in to my knees. It would also have been helpful if each of us had a copy of the Road Book, one copy between two is really not enough	Thank you for the feedback Ian. We've passed your comments on to the local supplier regarding the plastic envelopes. One road book per couple or room booked is pretty common for this type of holiday. If you would like one book per person please let us know at the time of booking next time.<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback Ian. By dispensing the tour books at the first hotel we are able to keep the costs of these holidays down. Posting quite weighty packs to our customers around the world would add definitely something to the selling price. Also, the value of the route information itself makes one reluctant to convert it to something that could be disseminated widely online.	3	3	3.00	5b478693e4b0208ae9d47601	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5b3b8c08e4b09b47826dece8/customer-review-need-road-book-earlier

I felt that I had to carefully check everything and seem to remember there were a couple of errors which needed amending .	We had a very enjoyable cycling tour arranged for us , going through interesting and picturesque parts of Brittany .The route details were clear and detailed with just an occasional query due to the translation from French . There were more stretches of on road riding than we wanted , particularly coming out of , and into , St Malo . The route on the last day was definitely better than the route on the first day from this point of view . There was a public holiday in the area on May 21st which , combined with good weather , meant that the Brittany coast was Heaving with traffic and people . We may well have changed our dates if we had been told of this .<br /><br />All in all though , a really good holiday with clean basic hotels and very good food .<br /><br />( Our room at the best western in Fougere was a bit small for our cycling gear and luggage but otherwise fine )	Glad you enjoyed the tour overall Sylvia and thanks for taking the time to provide this useful feedback.<br />Hi Sylvia, We pride ourselves on getting the detail right so if you do recall what those errors were we'd love to hear from you.	3	4	3.50	5b116906e4b0d53c9ea4e42f	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5b0018f5e4b0266be95bb03c/customer-review-

We had a great 4-day cycling trip in Umbria with Flexitreks. The bikes were in excellent condition, the hotels were very nice, and all of the services we received was great. The routes that they provided were top notch, small backcountry rodes that we would never have found on our own. Went through beautiful farm country, rolling Umbrian hills, and through a number of quaint cities and towns. Would definitely book again, a great experience!	Thank you so much for the lovely review Sophy and we look forward to discussing next year's trip soon.<br /><br />Thanks Sophy, we understand the pre-tour service is as important as the holiday itself.	5	5	5.00	5b0eab14e4b0a6e75bf8b75c	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5b0018f5e4b0266be95baf95/customer-review-great-cycling-trip-in-umbria

Pretty route - although we did get in a muddle about which route to take for best on one of the days and ended up cycling along a main road for a while.  Had we followed the main Moselle Cycling route sign with an 'M' we would have been alright!	Glad you enjoyed it despite the navigation issue.

Only 4 luggage labels were provided when we arrived - not 6 as we had been advised would be available. Also - there is no point in telling customers only one bag each is allowed so late in booking,. flight will have been booked by then.	Cycle paths and terrain was excellent. Countryside beautiful.<br /><br />Some of information is conflictng. Train tickets from Bad Gastein to Mallnitz are booked for a specific train. Written Information says you can get any train and they go once an hour from Bockstein	Thanks Alison, we're glad you enjoyed the route and scenery. In light of your comments we did check the validity of the train tickets to Mallnitz and are assured that the tickets provided are indeed valid for any train.<br />Thanks for the feedback Alison. Apologies for the bag/luggage label issue.

More attention to detail from the local suppliers would have made it excellent.<br /><br />Bag Transfer -  good,  nothing to criticise<br /><br />Hotels - v good with 2 exceptions,  Ludmila in Melnik - adequate but rather far out of centre, a little bit run down; Markiches Guthaus in Beeskow - possibly adequate but room (6) assigned were horrible attic rooms, far too hot and no way to ventilate<br /><br />Bike - not sized properly for shorter rider;  when we got a puncture the tool kit did not have a spanner that fitted front wheel lock so we could not get wheel off.  Fortunately we were not far from a place where support vehicle could reach us,,,,,we could have been a long way into the reed beds of the Spree.   The spare inner tube was for a road bike and would not have fitted the tyre.  Bike not oiled on collection and non supplied.  No map holder and no speedometer.   Chain slipping badly on one bike on gear change -  ie bikes not properly checked before supply in Czech Republic.  No water bottles supplied.<br /><br />Route instructions -  mostly good; but number and contact for support were NOT CORRECT in the documents;  also some street names incorrect; and some turns on the Cottbus to Beeskow legs very easy to miss.<br /><br />For Flexitreks :  Better description of the link between Dresden and Cottbus needed.   Yes there is a train but actually it took 3 1/2 hrs to go the 70 miles (as crow flies) with one change near the Polish border.  Not a problem in itself but hard to understand without the information.  No route for cycle option was provided and no explanation of the ticketing, train timetable etc.<br /><br />Also some of the distances seem incorrect.....in particular the Cottbus to Lubben leg in the guide has 2 stages and the combined distance is in the 45 - 50 mile range;  your summary only gives the distance for first stage.<br /><br />And finally we would recommend that the providers find an alternative stop to Beeskow or provide an option to make Lubben to Altstadt a single (longish) stage.....Beeskow as a town is dead with little to recommend it.<br /><br />But despite all that we had a great time !	Wow, a lot of very detailed and useful feedback here William - thanks! We're glad that you had a great time overall but rest assured we're addressing these issues with our local supplier to ensure future customers benefit from your recommendations. We're surprised about the bikes as they are usually well-maintained but that was obviously not your experience and we can only apologise for that.	4	4	4.00	5b260e82e4b04d4583502de4	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5b0018f5e4b0266be95bb019/customer-review-

The route was at times slightly disappointing- the terrain was a bit ordinary at times and some stretches were dull, particularly on the journey from Gallipoli to Leuca.

Eurobike: Good, but some details could be improved:<br /><br />Bikes in very good condition, no punctures or breakdowns, this was a massive positive<br /><br />Except the pick up on the milometers was only working on 2 of the 4 bikes – this was a major negative<br /><br />Detailed written directions were mainly good but to make this system work easily it depends on having a functioning milometer – which our navigator didn’t have<br /><br />Maps are too small scale<br /><br />We'd prefer directions drawn on large scale maps<br /><br />Some detail in the guidelines not correct: bus from Salzburg airport to hotel ganstlhof bus stop takes 30mins not 10,<br /><br />Some detail in the guidelines not clear: day2 we got lost coming into Steindorf & wasted some time going up & down the main road.<br /><br />Some detail out if date: day 3 Gasthof Schneiderwirt doesn't exist anymore, day 5 large part of central section out of date as R2 route that we follow has been diverted to follow a new (very scenic) route alongside the River Ischl from Kreutern to Weinbach.<br /><br />Tips were much appreciated eg the salt mines in Hallstatt were very good,<br /><br />Some tips out of date - we were told that the Schleedorf cheese factory closed 5yrs ago<br /><br />"Bathing opportunities" are mentioned in the eurobike guide. On some lakes the lakeside is almost totally carved up into private ownership so public swimming locations are very hard to find. Esp Irrsee & Mondsee & Attersee & Wolfgangsee.  More detail on public swimming locations would be appreciated. If one thing were to be changed about the organisation of the trip then this would be it.<br /><br />Hotels were excellent.	We're glad you enjoyed the holiday overall Peter and appreciate the constructive feedback. The bikes are checked before each outing and we're very sorry that two of the milometers on your group's bikes were not working. Our local supplier tells us he would have been happy to rectify this issue if it had been reported to him at any point during the holiday.

Unusually, maps were not clear on exact recommended route, especially on final day where much time was wasted finding route.  Directions leaving Munich given by Welcome Meeting host were incorrect.  Written directions to hotels poor - especially to Alpinhotel in Inzell (took us an hour to find as locals know this only as "The Sport Hotel").	Many thanks for the feedback.

The hotels were a fairly good, probably more 2 star plus than 3 star. However the fact that they were not top notch was more than compensated for by the friendly and helpful staff in each place. All the establishments were clean and breakfasts were good except in the Hotel du Grill.<br /><br />Luggage collection went smoothly.<br /><br />It would have been better if we had had a ‘meet and greet’ session on day 1. The bikes were delivered by a guy in a Hertz rental vehicle who explained that he had nothing to do with the company! That was not very reassuring. Requests to help with adjusting the saddle heights were met with ‘this is not my job’! He explained about the Allen Key located in one of the front panniers and in the end he did adjust our saddles. As I live in France part time I understand the French mentality but it’s somewhat baffling for people who are used to a more service orientated economy! First impressions are important. We are all experienced cyclists but a 15 minute orientation session would have  been helpful on the first day.<br /><br />The bike tracks were excellent and well signposted most of the way.<br /><br />However this was more challenging on the final day as we headed to Biarritz. We did quite a few extra Kms as directions were unclear.<br /><br />If we had experienced problems along the way I did not get the feeling that there was much back up. Fortunately we didn’t so I can’t speak from experience.<br /><br />.	Thanks for this constructive feedback which has been fed back to our local supplier. <br /><br />We aim to please. 	5	4	4.50	5b28905ee4b0e17729e495df	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5b0018f5e4b0266be95baf8f/customer-review-great-cycling-in-wonderful-scenery

There is also a great variety in culinary experiences while travelling through the two countries.<br /><br />Cycling in Denmark was much easier than in Germany due to the fact that the route was very well sign posted therefore we were thankful to have done it B to C rather than the other way round. If people decide to do C to Berlin you should definitely make them aware of this as it will otherwise come to a shock and pleasurable cycling will disappear!<br /><br />The hotels were generally fine however a few of them were not in the centre of a town which limits the options for evening meal. The problem we encountered was that we hadn’t booked a tablet in the hotel’s restaurant and therefore had to wait a long time before we could eat. As this was only in low season I dread to think what would happen in July/ August. Would it not be better to offer half board in such hotels or recommend that people immediately book a table on arrival in the hotel.<br /><br />We experienced a lot of trouble with the E bike for Paul; the first one had a problem with the connections in the back of the speedometer which meant while cycling along all of a sudden the power would drop which happened very intermiitently; Mecklenburger tour operator swapped the bike the next day however its battery was only partly charged so we ended up having to charge it for more than an hour before we could carry on. The second problem with the second bike was the magnet on the rear spokes came off and we could not lock itback into position so ended up taping it to the spoke!<br /><br />The overall problem for us was that the battery of the ebike did not hold charge enough to do the preplanned amount of km per day so we ended up with having to charge it min 2x a day...	Thanks for the detailed feedback Simone. We'll certainly recommend customers book a table on arrival at the hotels in future. Sorry about the bike issues - our local supplier belives this was simple bad luck as the bikes are serviced after each rental and such issues are unusual.<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback Simone. By dispensing the tour books at the first hotel we are able to keep the costs of these holidays down. Posting these quite weighty packs to our customers around the world would add quite lot to the price.	3	4	3.50	5b38f5cce4b0234b08e6eaad	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5b0018f5e4b0266be95bb009/customer-review-berlin-to-copenhagen-offers-variety-in-many-ways

Some of the paperwork was missing when we got to the first hotel (detailed route map and bike hire paperwork).  This was resolved by the bike hire company and because we've been on a lot of cycling holidays we weren't too stressed out - but new cyclists probably would be.	Loved the cycling, its by far the best cycle tour we have been on.  Vienna RoomZ hotel is not the best choice though.  Very industrial sort of location and miles away from train stations.  Also not the cleanest hotel ever and room was overcrowded as they had put a third bed in a pretty small double room.ou	Glad you enjoyed it so much and message received regarding your hotel in Vienna.<br /><br />Profuse apologies for the missing paperwork but glad it was resolved before you set off on your first ride.	4	4	4.00	5b3f771ce4b0f7360d0384fc	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5b0018f5e4b0266be95bafcf/customer-review-

The colours are also not the clearest. You would soon get lost if you were relying on their signs. Directions and maps ok when used in conjunction with GPS maps.<br /><br />I think that the cost of hiring the bikes should include insurance and not be told that you will have to pay for the bike if it gets stolen. Each bike should be provided with spare inner tube and repair kit in case couples want to go off and do their own thing sometimes.<br /><br />It is clearly not compulsory to wear bike helmets in Slovenia. Don’t take one if you don’t wear one normally.<br /><br />Hotels in Slovenia<br /><br />1. Lake bled hotel Kompas<br /><br />Large clean friendly. Facilities ++ not tested. Good location close to restaurants and lake. Room was clean and average size. Good breakfast.<br /><br />2. Bohinj eco hotel @ bohinjska bistrica<br /><br />Large clean hotel. Facilities ++ not tested. Good dining room. Ate at local restaurant. Very good room. Nice bathroom. Good breakfast. Friendly helpful staff.  Secure parking facilities.<br /><br />3. Mini hotel @ skofja loka<br /><br />Little bit out of town centre. Little bit dated but clean and comfortable. Sports facilities on site? More basic than other hotels. No AC. Ok for 3 star. Good basic breakfast.<br /><br />4. M hotel @ Ljubljana<br /><br />Large chain hotel. Too far out of town, especially when helia recommend that you do not take your bikes into town as they will inevitably get stolen. I can understand why we were not closer to the centre last night due to the lack of alternatives but surely there are more conveniently located places to stay in Ljubljana. Disappointing choice.<br /><br />Secure parking and good modern room.<br /><br />Would recommend an extra night in Ljubljana as not enough time to see the place.<br /><br />5. Montova hotel, Vrinka<br /><br />Good location, easy to find, friendly staff. Good restaurant attached to hotel. Room slightly dated. Limited choice for breakfast.<br /><br />6. Kars hotel, Povoskya<br /><br />Clean modern hotel central location. Large AC room with good en suite. Good breakfast.<br /><br />7. His a Posebne Sorta @ Kodreti<br /><br />Guest house with 4 rooms and 4 apartments in a rural location. Warm welcome, clean and comfortable. Evening meal at the hotel (which was very good home cooked food- 3 courses with wine € ) unless you have transportation. Poor/ no internet during our stay.<br /><br />8. Hotel Malovec @ Divaca<br /><br />Large bright room with balcony. Secure underground parking.  Attached to restaurant serving mostly traditional Slovenian food. Not much to do in Divaca.<br /><br />9. Hotel SAN Rocco @Muggia<br /><br />Modern hotel, near the sea front almost 1 km from the town square. Secure garage parking. Good reception and room.  Outdoor swimming pool.  Good breakfast.<br /><br />10. Hotel Tartini @ Piran<br /><br />Very good location in the town square. Near to all amenities. Recently refurbished in industrial/ minimalist style. Will look nice when it’s finished and there are places to put your things on etc. Secure parking. Lovely terrace with sea and town views. Good restaurant on site. Unfortunately they only have 3 twin rooms and they gave ours away to someone else!<br /><br />Hotel told us they had advised Helia, who did not inform us.<br /><br />Otherwise a lovely holiday. Thanks for your help in arranging it.	Many thanks for taking the time to provide such detailed feedback Trevor. Bike insurance is something that very few bike operators offer. We are told it is quite hard to come by and those that do offer it tend to fund and run the scheme themselves. Your comments about the signage have been fed back to our local operator and I'm glad the GPX tracks we supplied were put to good use. <br /><br />Many thanks Trevor we appreciate the recommendation.	4	4	4.00	5b3360efe4b077f689ad1839	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5b0018f5e4b0266be95bafdb/customer-review-very-good-self-guided-cycle-tour-in-a-lovely-country

On the whole Evazio (Flexitreks sub-contractor who actually provided the guts of the touring holiday) provided an excellent service which is hard to fault. However, it would have been much better had we each been provided with a copy of the Road Book	Glad to hear you were happy with the local service Ian.<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback Ian. By dispensing the tour books at the first hotel we are able to keep the costs of these holidays down. We believe that most customers are content to receive the information at the first hotel but your opinion that they should be distributed in advance has been noted.	3	4	3.50	5b4787eee4b06709a71ab854	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5b3b8c08e4b09b47826decd8/customer-review-road-book-earlier

The cycling was very easy leaving us lots of time to explore the pretty villages and towns and swim in the lake. Most of the hotels were above average and all of the staff in them were friendly and helpful.The luggage ferry had always arrived before we did.  We were relieved that we had a GPS and had downloaded the software Flexitreks offered us. We met a couple of tourists who found it hard to navigate just with a map. The weather in June was perfect for cycling between 19-24 c and we only had one rainy day. We are now planning the next one	Excellent - many thanks for the lovely review Julia. GPX tracks are definitely the way to go if you have a smartphone and as long as you download the route before leaving home you don't even use any of your data allowance during the rides.<br /><br />Thanks Julia. Ally loves Lake Constance and it sounds like you do too now.	5	5	5.00	5b30a942e4b08140a3ea99a4	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5b0018f5e4b0266be95bb079/customer-review-fabulous-holiday

I found communication prompt and easy	The cycles provided were very good, with one panier and a a capacious handlebar bag.<br /><br />The route itself was quite varied. In the main downhill, or on the level, although the optional route by the Kalteresee did involve some stiff climbs.<br /><br />I was travelling by myself, but often bumped into other people, mainly Norwegian and German, doing the same trip and we were able to chat and compare notes.<br /><br />I particularly chose this trip because of the voyage down Lake Garda - very well worth it.	Many thanks for taking the time to review this popular route. The optional diversion via Kalterersee does indeed involve a bit more climbing but we think the wonderful views, as you descend towards the lake, make it all worthwhile. The ferry ride the length of Lake Garda is both spectacular and a welcome opportunity to relax after the morning ride from Trento.<br /><br />Very nice to hear - thank you.	5	5	5.00	5b32b778e4b03148d6e10a12	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5b0018f5e4b0266be95baf7a/customer-review-enjoyable-and-varied-holiday

Flexitreks advised some pre-work which was important ensuring we minimised routing errors.  Definitely recommend downloading GPX maps.	Yes, a small amount of pre-trip work familiarising oneself with the GPX tracks and app is definitely time well spent!<br /><br />Excellent - we're glad you were happy with everything.	5	5	5.00	5b48b383e4b0e8d98e54aeec	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5b3b8c08e4b09b47826ded40/customer-review-what-a-wonderful-holiday

All hotels good apart from the first one in Bolzano called<br /><br />Premstaller.A dump and miles<br /><br />Away from the town.Cost us a fortune in taxis.The boat ride on Lake Garda took 5 and a half hours!! Far too long. Cycling excellent and most downhill.	Thanks for the feedback Ernest. Sorry to hear you were not so keen on the Premstaller but glad you had an excellent trip all the same. The ferry journey on Lake Garda tends to divide opinion - some really appreciate the break and the fantastic scenery, others find it a bit too long - you are obviously in the latter category.<br /><br />We aim to please.	5	5	5.00	5b4c4207e4b0af1910f05d8c	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5b3b8c08e4b09b47826ded22/customer-review-easy-booking

As a new cruise itinerary this year perhaps the amount of cycling needs a little adjustment, I would have preferred more.<br /><br />Most days were full board, a couple were half board. I would recommend the last day (in Dubrovnik) is changed to half Board as it makes little sense to have to return to the boat for dinner and then return to Dubrovnik (taking into account to strict rules being applied to mooring of boats in Dubrovnik)	Many thanks for the useful feedback Graham and we're glad you loved the boat. Plans are afoot to amend the route and cycling slightly for next year and your feedback will definitely be taken into account.<br /><br />Thanks Graham and we agree, communication is everything!	5	5	5.00	5b4ebdcde4b042bd27558321	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5b3b8c08e4b09b47826ded27/customer-review-a-fanstastic-cycling-cruising-holiday-experience

Some of the hotels were difficult to locate with little or hard to follow directions but we found them all eventually. We could not locate the drop off point for our bikes on the last day and so cycled all the way to the hotel.	We're glad you found the holiday enjoyable and relaxing. We will try to make the directions to the bike drop-off point in Vienna clearer for future customers. That said, I also chose to cycle to my hotel instead of dropping the bike off and believe it saved my quite a lot of time.

We were provided with seven speed hub gears instead of the advertised 21 gear bikes. I especially had difficulty with the hills on these bikes. By the second day we knew they weren’t going to work for us and contacted Ally to say we’d take a day off cycling the next day (and to and fro Krimml Falls) so the supplier could change our bikes. This was resolved without issue from either Flexitreks or the supplier.<br /><br />Apart from that hiccup, we loved everything about this tour. The cycling tracks, scenery, accommodation were all wonderful. Would definitely recommend this tour.	Sorry about the bike issue Brenda.

However, I felt that there was a bit of a lack of clarity over the type of terrain that we would be cycling on.  This was important to me as we were cycling with young children, and I wanted to make sure that they were on bikes which were as well suited to the terrain as possible.	My wife and I went on this cycling holiday with our three children, aged between 9 and 11.  I was concerned that my 9 year old daughter would struggle with the distances, so chose this route as (i) the distances are relatively short, and (ii) some of the days can be shortened by taking a train ride.  In the event, the children managed very well, and no shortcuts were needed.  Do not use road tyres by the way - some of the off-road sections are completely unsuitable for road tyres.<br /><br />Highlights for us included the cycling on the second day (from Bonndorf to Waldhut Tiengen), afternoons spent at outdoor swimming pools, the lake in Freiburg near Hotel Bischofslinde, swimming in the Rhine, meeting other cyclists en route.<br /><br />All of the pre-booked hotels were excellent.	Many thanks Adam, I'm so glad it all went so well for you all.<br /><br />Thanks Adam, I'm glad you and your family enjoyed the holiday. Hopefully, the GPX tracks of the route, sent to you in advance of your trip, helped you to understand the terrain you would be encountering on each of the rides.	4	5	4.50	5ba29cdbe4b0b7b018d1064b	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5b728e54e4b0b57ee3dd1d89/customer-review-great-cycling-holiday

The chap shrugged his shoulders and said “follow brown signs”! This was somewhat worrying since this was our first ever cycling holiday. One lady in our group of 4 was given a mans bike and we had no repair kit or pump between the 4 of us (meant to have one between two). Eventually the bike was changed to a ladies bike but never did fit properly and we were given one repair kit.	Very sorry to hear about these issues at the start Jane.

The first day's route was very dull, however on the second and third days it was beautiful.<br /><br />The rooms however, were very basic and one didn't have air conditioning. Given that we'd paid extra for superior rooms this was unpleasant with the temperatures in the mid thirties. Coming back from a cycle in this heat and finding the room is roasting was unpleasant.<br /><br />Furthermore on the second night the bike storage was locked away in a garage down the road. The key was in the lobby and I couldn't get access to it until 8am, meaning I couldn't get an early start to avoid the heat.<br /><br />The directions were good, although the map itself was badly designed: When placing it in the handlebar holder the map for each section and the corresponding directions are on opposite sides! Meaning that if you're following the map you may not be able to see the specific street names, and if you follow the direction it's hard to keep orientated. This meant places where I had to stop, take it out, flip it over, read it, flip it over, put it back in ETC ETC Repeatedly! If the design had  the map and directions on one side it would have a lot more useful.<br /><br />Also, the larger document with details of various sights to be seen was in German, and meant I had to rely on my smartphone to find attractions, which I'd hope to avoid.	Thanks for the useful feedback James. While the first hotel you stayed in did have air conditioning, it's true the others didn't. In this part of Germany AC is quite rare in the smaller traditional properties as the weather isn't often that hot, Like the UK, Germany had a particularly hot summer this year and many places saw record temperatures. <br />\\n<br />\\nYour recommendations regarding the map design are very valid and I have passed these on to our local supplier. <br />Glad to hear the pre-tour service was good James.	4	3	3.50	5b8bcc11e4b0ed32d55a79f1	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5b728e54e4b0b57ee3dd1dc5/customer-review-poor-accommodation-but-otherwise-good

We did not receive any maps or made aware of what materials would be given to us before we arrived so had already purchased the blue books with the routes in.  We now have duplicate copies.	On the whole we really enjoyed this holiday. Why we have only given 4 stars and not 5 was to do with the bikes, some of the accommodation and the complete lack of route explanation for the second week.<br /><br />Bikes<br /><br />We had opted for electric bikes however the bikes provided by Donau Touristik were very heavy and cumbersome. This effectively cancelled out the benefit of the motor. Other companies we saw had much better bikes. Also other companies provided handlebar bags which showed the map clearly in addition to the panniers.  Also charging the bikes was quite tricky at some locations as we could not remove the batteries from the bikes. Not all of the hotels were able to charge all the e bikes in the secure areas<br /><br />Hotels<br /><br />The range of hotels was eclectic.  In the main the hotels were very good. However the Thermal Hotel at Mosonmagyarovar was particularly bad reminding us of a nursing home.  The decor was tired and the spa baths on the website did not belong to the hotel but were the public swimming pool. The town had no attractions other than a surfeit of beauticians and dental clinics. We were provided with rail tickets to get to Gior but this did not include tickets for our bikes which we had to purchase. Not a problem but a little inconsistent.<br /><br />On arrival in Vienna the hotel was not prepared for people continuing on to Budapest and said they had no bike storage facilities. This was quickly sorted out by the holiday provider. However people starting there holiday on Vienna and cycling to Budapest were given a welcome chat and told about the route. This would have been useful to us as in Passau the route was only explained as far as Vienna.<br /><br />We would do a similar holiday again but not with Donau Touristik as the bike provider.	Glad you really enjoyed the route Lindsay but sorry to hear you were not so impressed with other elements of the trip. Most of our customers are very pleased with the quality of bikes provided on our Danube routes so this is rather unusual for us. Rest assured I have fed your comments back to our local supplier on this subject. Accommodation options in and around Mosonmagyarovar are rather limited but we are working to find a better solution for this overnight. We will also ensure that future welcome meetings cover the whole route all the way to Budapest.<br /><br />Oh dear, sorry to read this Lindsay. Our website does make it clear that maps and route notes are provided. Additionally, your holiday documentation, sent to you 5 weeks prior to your trip, confirmed that the maps and route notes would be waiting for you at the reception desk of your first hotel.	1	4	2.50	5b8c353ee4b0e3fe0fe1a1ff	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5b3b8c08e4b09b47826deccf/customer-review-

Wizz airlines (to Slovenia) made some itinerary changes which did not suit us and we were charged to change the flights to different days but this was NOT an issue with Flexitreks.	Beautiful scenery and great mixture of hotels to stay in; great food in all the half boards. Local team really helpful - had to miss a couple of days cycling (due to gout!) but still had to move on each day - transport for us, bikes and luggage arranged.	Thanks for the lovely review Stephen. I'm sorry to hear you had to miss a couple of days riding and I'm glad our local team was able to get you to your next hotel. <br /><br />Thanks Stephen, I'm glad all went well despite the airline issues.	5	5	5.00	5ba251a2e4b0d3c256e1c638	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5ba20f35e4b03463cdebff44/customer-review-a-great-week

Adjustments were made to a standard tour to meet our specific requirements.<br /><br />When our flight was cancelled on the day we were due to fly Flexitreks contacted bicycle hire, hotels etc in Austria to enable some of our party to start the cycle tour a day late from a different start point. The help, advice and support we received from Flexitreks was excellent - in stark contrast to that of Lufthansa!	This was out first ever cycling holiday and served as a great introduction for a family of occasional weekend cyclists.  Bicycle hire, luggage transfer, hotels and other logistics are worked smoothly enabling us to enjoy the holiday.<br /><br />The cycling distances were easy and the route was predominantly flat and on cycle paths or quiet lanes. Hotels were of a good standard, mostly with restaurants, some with pool, some with positions right on the river.<br /><br />We cycled during August when temperatures were rose towards 35 degrees. This was hot for cycling and few of the hotels had air conditioning.<br /><br />We will definitely look to go on a cycling holiday again - and Flexitreks will be our first point of contact.	Thanks for taking the time to write such a thorough and helpful review Gary. Hopefully you are now all firm converts to leisure cycling holidays!<br /><br />Thanks Gary - we're glad the cancelled flight didn't upset the holiday.	5	5	5.00	5b7d4dd7e4b0f6cecd158b7e	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5b728e55e4b0b57ee3dd1e09/customer-review-excellent-service

As we’d previously cycled Passau to Vienna, we wanted to end this tour in Regensburg. Ally and Andy sorted this without issue. Thanks again!	Again a great cycling experience. Was great to see the Danube at its source and see it widen as we professed east. Enjoyed the  accommodation. We had no issues on this trip.	This stretch of the 'young' Danube is stunning and often overlooked in favour of the more well known Passau to Vienna section. We're so glad you enjoyed it.<br /><br />Glad we were able to tailor this trip for you Brenda and thanks for your kind words.	5	5	5.00	5b8c93c3e4b0ce26dd3331c4	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5b3b8c07e4b09b47826dec07/customer-review-

The scenery particularly the first couple of days was spectacular.<br /><br />There was too much faffing about collecting people and forgotten bikes the first day. It was after 11 am before we actually got on our bikes.<br /><br />The day getting to the ferry at lake Garda felt like too much pressure. No time for a decent lunch stop and no time for a swim!  Plus arrival at hotel in Peschiera was too late to use the pool.  I think day 6, Trento to Peschiera would be better as two days for folk like us.<br /><br />The hotel in Mantova was disappointing.  Felt more like 2 than 3 stars. Though the staff were nice.	Thanks for the feedback Susan and I'm glad you enjoyed it overall. It sounds like you had a rather stuttering start to the holiday and I can only apologize for that. As there is only one ferry a day from the north to the southern end of the lake our options are rather limited here but it's worth noting the 6 night version of this tour concludes on the north shore, thereby removing the need to race for the ferry.<br /><br />Thanks Susan, we really appreciate the feedback. 	5	4	4.50	5ba26fcae4b0d3c256e23116	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5ba20f34e4b03463cdebfede/customer-review-mountain-to-city-by-the-scenic-route

Clear information and itinerary- perhaps would have been good to have the itinerary a little earlier for planning purposes, but nevertheless it was helpful.	Bikes were good and comfortable. Maps were clear as well as directions. Only had one problem, leaving Chartres, because the road was closed for maintenance so did a detour. Hotels very friendly and some of the hotel restaurants were excellent. Eg Hotel Le Cygne at St. Hilaire du Harcouet. Particularly liked the Hotel L’Auberpines at Illiers-Combray which was delightful. Only let down was the Normandie Country Club at Belleme. It felt deserted. The swimming pool and health area has closed down and no open restaurant so we had a 30 minute walk each way into the town to get food. The taxi service transporting our bags was excellent and we thoroughly enjoyed our 8 day’s of cycling through beautiful countryside ending at the beautiful Mont St. Michel.	Thank you so much for taking the time to provide such comprehensive and useful feedback Mike.<br /><br />So glad you enjoyed it Mike - sounds like the weather was spot on!	4	4	4.00	5b5eb21ee4b0217f095487fd	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5b3b8c08e4b09b47826ded34/customer-review-a-wonderful-experience-8-glorious-days-cycling-through-french-countryside

Me and my 13 year old had a great time cycling through this really beautiful part of the world. One tough day, but the rest was pretty good. Worth noting that the bikes are heavy - ideal for flat/downhill as they are super-stable but hard work (for me anyway) going uphill, so we stuck to the non-hilly options. The logistics worked smoothly and once we got the hang of the instructions, I found them clear to follow.	Thanks for the great review Tami and glad you both enjoyed it so much.<br /><br />So glad we helped you select the right holiday Tami - hopefully you are now a convert to leisure cycling holidays!	5	4	4.50	5b72941ee4b0ede63b9569be	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5b728e54e4b0b57ee3dd1d8d/customer-review-a-great-holiday

The leg from Passau to Vienna was better than the leg from Vienna to Hungary.  The luggage always arrived at our new destination.<br /><br />Directions:  Can be improved.  Donau provided the instructions on how to get to the next hotel, but were written by someone whose first language was not English.  Did not translate well.<br /><br />Hotels:  All hotels were fine.  However, the hotel in Mosonmagyrovar was a disaster.  The so called Thermal Hotel had no outdoor space, and there was an extra charge for the thermal pool.  That makes no sense.  A water main broke so no water in hotel room, couldn't take a shower, the staff seemed not to care, no water brought to the room, no announcements.  Terrible service!!!  The hotel looks like a strip mall.  It looks like they are preparing for demolition.  Take this hotel off of the list.<br /><br />NH Danube City.  Bike storage was in the basement,  It flooded and we had to wade in water a foot deep to get our bikes.  This was raised with staff, they indicated it always floods when it rains.  Not good enough!  Need to find another place for the bikes if that is the case.<br /><br />The trails were generally unmarked and closed in some places without signage.  Some trails were basically not ride-able and we had to take the highway.<br /><br />The leg from Mosonmagyrovar should be eliminated, because of the hotel and the need to take a train to Gyor.  You get off the train in Gyor and no signage to Komano.  The instructions said:<br /><br />Along the Slovakian cycle path (64 kms).  No directions on how to get there.  In the end the cycle path was closed in any event. The statements by Donau stated )" Each bike traveller has to make his own decision, how to come up against damaged sections of the cycle paths, (dismount, tow bike etc)"  Not very helpful, but described what we were up against in some of the latter sections of the trip.<br /><br />Positives:  Great bikes, luggage always arrived on time, great hotels except the Thermal hotel, food good.<br /><br />Negatives:  The trails from Vienna to Budapest need some work, a lot of riding on the roads to get from one town to another.	Thank you for the detail feedback Bud. I'm really sorry about these issues you encountered on this route. First off, we are working hard with our local supplier to find a replacement hotel in Mosonmagyrovar - this is a priority. The flooding in the bike storage area of the NH Danube is news to us and we have asked for reassurances via our local supplier that this will be fixed. It sounds like the trail between Venice and Budapest was in particularly bad shape at the time of your trip - possibly due to bad weather - but it's fair to say this section is not as well maintained as the Austrian section. We've asked our local supplier to reassess the path and routes notes prior the 2019 season.<br /><br />Thanks Bud,we appreciate the feedback.	4	3	3.50	5bafcba4e4b041fb94bae39f	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5ba20f34e4b03463cdebfec4/customer-review-the-trip-started-on-a-positive-note

Helpful staff on telephone	Our boat was “Melody” which was well appointed.  Excellent cabin, much bigger than expected.  Friendly staff.  Tour guides Kini & Matija were very friendly and helpful.<br /><br />My wife and I were involved in a little accident along with 2 other bikers.  Dini very good and dealt with the situation.  Beware roads can get slippery when there is only a little rain!!<br /><br />Tour itself was organised well and as expected from itenary. Disappointed not to get to Hvar. I think there was a problem getting a slot in busy harbour but I know the sister ship Romantica went there the same morning.<br /><br />If I was to criticise anything I would suggest not trying to get back for lunches on the boat but to stay out & stop at more places on the islands.<br /><br />Overall - a great holiday.  Can’t wait for the next one	Thanks for the helpful feedback Mark. Because rain is quite a rare thing in the summer months it's true that when there is precipitation the roads can become quite slick. We'll bear the point about lunches on the road in mind but we're also aware that many customers like returning to the boat for a proper meal.<br /><br />Fantastic - many thanks Mark.	5	5	5.00	5b5ed9e9e4b0f02789ce6de8	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5b3b8c07e4b09b47826dec1f/customer-review-great-holiday-by-boat-bike

Suggests Flexitreks not particularly attuned to what the tour involved etc.	Great itinerary, food on board was fine (our boat was "New Star"). Overall a great experience, somewhat spoiled when air-con in all cabins failed on last night (33 deg heat, can't open any windows in downstairs cabins). Got the impression the boat owner was trying to minimise costs e.g. no complimentary tea/coffee etc. Promoted as a luxury cruise, but doesn't come across that way.<br /><br />Flexitreks website lacking detailed info on the cycling required. Website described the cycling as "leisurely". It is if you use an e-bike, but not otherwise. One day involved 900m of climbing in 35 deg heat. I'm a fit cyclist, so it didn't bother me, but it is not "leisurely".	Thanks Anthony, we're glad that overall you had a great experience and sorry about the AC failure. We agreed with our local bike guides at the start of the season that this new route was leisurely, however following your comments and subsequent discussions with the bike guides we have amended it to a leisurely/moderate route.<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback Anthony. The last minute changes came from the local bike guides themselves. This is a brand new route this year and the guides realised - after running the trip for a few weeks -  that some changes would likely enhance the customer experience. We therefore agreed to pass these changes onto our customers.	3	4	3.50	5b7a4314e4b02306a284298e	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5b3b8c07e4b09b47826dec02/customer-review-

This was my favourite tour out of the five we completed over a six week period. The conditions of the cycling paths were great, the bikes themselves were the best we’d experienced, loved the routes,scenery and overnight locations, particularly Kranjska Gora. The Slovenians we met we’re so lovely and friendly. Accommodation was excellent, with the final hotel accommodation at Lake Bled outstanding - Hotel Triglav on the lake.

We found this the least favourite of our five cycling tours.

Our first guided cycling holiday which took a day or so to get used to but the benefits were traveling with a lovely mix of people made for great fun and our guides, Silvia and Matija, were excellent.  The information we gained during the stops helped enormously.<br /><br />We were very comfortable on the Princeza Diana - all the crew were superb. Weather was great and using E bikes certainly helped with the hills! Highlights were the rafting, traveling into Korcula Town with stunning views and having dolphins accompany us on our voyage from Vis to Korcula.	Another convert it seems. The Princeza Diana has an ever growing fan base as we're glad you enjoyed the e-bikes - they are the perfect option, in our opinion, for tackling these rather undulating rides.<br /><br />Thank you so much for the kind words - we really appreciate it!	5	5	5.00	5baba9f9e4b0704f366c914d	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5ba20f35e4b03463cdebff24/customer-review-excellent-holiday

Food + accommodation was v good- lovely rooms, attentive staff- we were able to check in at all 3 hotels early in the afternoon. Luggage transfer was super efficient - bags already at the hotels even though we arrived early.<br /><br />The cycling route directions provided by “Walk-in” were very detailed and  helpful.

The boat crew and the guides were all absolutely excellent at looking after us- and that was not easy. We were a group of four with 3 cyclists of mixed ability and one non-cyclist. We were none of us fast or very proficient. Our guide managed to keep us all included as we cycled through some breathtaking countryside and towns.<br /><br />The boat's crew were wonderful especially the cook who prepared soft or puréed food for one of us every evening.<br /><br />The other people on the holiday were good too: helpful and good- humoured.	Great to hear it all went so well Bryony. The Fluvius really is a happy ship and I'm glad the crew looked after you so well.<br /><br />Thanks Bryony - we really appreciate the feedback!	5	5	5.00	5b8c467de4b0ce26dd329b0f	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5b728e54e4b0b57ee3dd1d54/customer-review-

I had emailed asking for hotel names at start and finish and these were given very promptly.<br /><br />The negative comment was one of our bikes needed some attention on the first day.  We had to find a cycle shop to buy a tool to tighten front head stem which was very loose and chain oil as chain needed oiling.  The pedal also clicked the whole trip. This was the men's bike.  The panniers also had sand in the bottom.  A shake out would have been good.	Fantastic trails.   We used the GPX file sent by tour company and found that to be brilliant.  In fact getting out of Amsterdam would have been really tricky if we had had to have stopped to look at the intersection numbers at every turn.  Accommodation mostly excellent.  Wondered why we stayed in Schuddebeurs where there was no other option for meal?  Quite expensive when there was another town nearby.  Also room at Maraboe very very small.  We stayed an extra 3 nights in another much better room with a decent sized bathroom.	Thanks Annette  - the GPX files are winning over everyone and onceused to using them, it's hard to consider going back to maps (although it's nice to know these are always provided as a back-up). Hotel selection is often linked to good quality properties that can also offer adequate, safe overnight storage for the bikes. The property in  Schuddebeurs is one such property and from there it's only a 10 minute bike ride, along the cycle path, back into Zierikzee where there are many places to eat.<br /><br />Thank you for the comprehensive review Annette and sorry to read about the problems with the bike. The bikes are usually maintained well but it sounds like this one slipped through the net somehow. It's always a good idea to give the bikes a good once over when you take delivery of them so that any niggles like this can be sorted before setting off.	4	4	4.00	5b8c21c8e4b0f94754973bf9	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5b728e54e4b0b57ee3dd1cc9/customer-review-

Well thought out routes mainly on quiet roads and tracks. Good directions. Interesting routes through flat farmland and some hillier rides with olive groves, vineries and woodland.<br /><br />Cycling not too challenging, and as the weather was hot for our trip , so we enjoyed being able to do most or all of the cycling in the morning and spend our afternoons exploring the amazing medieval towns, all fascinating, and all had something special . Our hotels were great as was the food and wine.<br /><br />We would recommend this holiday to those who want to combine some cycling with exploring historic towns, churches, castles and galleries and luxury hotels. You may not have heard of the towns, but we enjoyed them and think they were nicer for us to visit than the more famous and more touristy cites.

The choice to go to Mantova was a good one as such a beautiful relaxing ride on the final day and still had chance to visit Verona on following day by train.	Fabulous trip along the beautiful Adige river with some interesting cycling and opportunity to take breaks in scenic local towns. The cycling was varied though generally downhill, we took option to take some of the hillier variants available. Hotels generally fine and no issues with bag transfers. Only minor point would be to stay in alternate hotel in Bolzano on first day, as far out of centre and no books available to cycle in.<br /><br />Really enjoyable trip and would throughly recommend	Many thanks for the lovely review Mike. I hear you regarding the Bolzano hotel and our local supplier is looking at this but the issue is it's quite hard to find centrally located hotels with sufficient storage space for the bikes.<br /><br />Thanks Mike - always nice to get name checked on a positive review 😃.

The booking confirmation came through on time and all the arrangements went according to plan on our holiday.	We expected a few complaints from our girls about some of the distances (up to 22 miles some days) but they never did. I think it was such a different kind of holiday and was one big adventure. You can stop anytime and admire or enjoy the surroundings. Every day was different. The weather was fantastic. One day we cheated and got the train because it was so hot and the water park next to the hotel was too good to miss. My only disappointment was one of the hotels which was more like a hostel and the bedsheets and standard reflected that. Stains and holes in the sheets are not acceptable. Would we do it again? A resounding yes! We have lots of wonderful memories of our holiday and would definitely go back to Flexitreks to book again.

Good cycling routes with interesting places to visit. Very nice bikes and nice quiet roads. Terrain was challenging in bits but mainly due to heat which was 30 + every day. Good maps and notes from the Flexitrek's local partner. We had the 'wine room' at Monte do Serrado Baixo which was great - the use of the outdoor swimming pool and very nice breakfasts and evening meals prepared by the team at the farmhouse. The town of Evora which is a short trip away from the farmhouse was really historic and interesting with lots of good eating places and interesting shops.

I would have liked to been given more of an option regarding lodging and location, as we were less than happy with the location in Cobourg and Honfleur. Also, in respect to directions, we could not get our bike speedometers to reset so that we could track distances which resulted in our getting lost a few times. Instructions would be useful.	Thanks Kirsten, we appreciate the feedback. It is possible to reset the odometers and you should have been shown how to do this at the start of the holiday.

It was however, fairly bare bones as far as what to expect and problems that might be encountered.  I think they should have recommended a GPS unit for your bike.	Flexitreks provided good organization, good hotels and very efficient transfer of luggage.  The route is spectacular and the hotels for the most part were excellent.  However, the directions, especially after Vienna left much to be desired.  After Vienna trail markings are much fewer and we felt very fortunate to team up with some other riders that had a GPS with the trails downloaded.  Sometimes the hotels were hard to find because of traffic and lack of street names.  In Bratislavia the hotel needed to be closer to the city center.  The first Thermal hotel in Mosonmagyaroavr was clearly not as nice as any of the other hotels.  (The staff was friendly though) A hotel in Gyor would have been much better for the  route because it would allow an earlier start on a difficult day  and Gyor seemed like a more interesting town.   We found this out because it was very difficult to find the trail through the town of Gyor.  The Slovakia trails out of Gyor were very difficult and there was little guidance to choose which side of the Danube to ride on at that juncture. On the Slovakia side we chose, there was actually a 20 Kilometer stretch on thick gravel that was very hard to bike on.  The final day of the journey had two options but no explanation was given on the difficulty or ease of riding all the way into Budapest.  We chose to leave our bikes at the early stop and take the train in and that seemed to be the best option.  We were not given good directions to the train station so that caused a problem.  The hotel in Budapest was very nice but too far from the historical center of the city.  At least an option for a city center hotel should be provided.<br /><br />The rental bikes were heavy but were very good under many different trail conditions.  It was great to have panniers provided.	Many thanks for the detailed feedback Kristen. We hear you regarding the property in Mosonmagyarovara and I can assure you that our local suppliers are working hard to find a replacement. It seems the route between Vienna and Budapest has deteriorated somewhat this Summer and in the off-season our local supplier will be reassessing both the route and the route notes prior to the 2019 season.<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback Kristen.

The bicycles were in excellent condition and the hotels selected were of a high standard. The directions included small roads and tracks away from the highways and were very expicit and helpful. It was a marvelous holiday and I will certainly be repeating it if I can.	Sounds idyllic, we look forward to being of service again soon Richard.<br /><br />Thanks Richard, we appreciate the feedback.	5	5	5.00	5bb8baabe4b0501f195f1917	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5bb62676e4b08b3f10279878/customer-review-umbria-umbria-wherefore-art-thy-umbria

The accommodation was fantastic and the bikes were really good quality. The local cycling team were very helpful. The only point to note was the timings of the bookings at the wineries which didn't work as they were very late in the day. Having never done a cycling trip before I didn't think to check this but if you cycle and know how fast you cycle then suggest you ensure you book early and get specific times. This was more my error then theirs and I would definitely recommend Flexi treks and will be using them again	Quiet roads and pretty villages. We did 2 days of cycling in very different terrains one road and one predominantly eco trail so it was lovely to do both. Accommodation was fab with lovely service.	Lovely - so glad everything went well and you enjoyed it so much Marijke.<br /><br />Thanks for the kind words Marijke and you make a good point about the winery visiting times.	5	5	5.00	5bb9b474e4b0b90ede3ba456	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5bb62676e4b08b3f102798be/customer-review-great-service-will-be-booking-again

It was a great trip and overall the hotels were better than I thought. Directions to and from the hotels to the start of the trail could be better though. A couple of hotels were not in the ideal part of town for sightseeing (but good hotels) and one hotel  needs to be scrapped from the agenda. The views are stunning and the ride spectacular.

I recently took this trip and decided on an e-bike - a great decision! While I did get a good work each day, I appreciated the assistance given on the many hills. I was able to have time to explore even more hillside towns and villages and the stunning views at a leisurely pace and still be in time to meet with my ’new found cycling friends’ for an aperitif before dinner!<br /><br />The choice of food and wine each evening is great. The hotels were great - offered spacious rooms and super breakfasts.<br /><br />If you are at all worried about doing this trip as you think it may be too tough then take the e-bike and discover an amazing region.

Maps and booklet were detailed and accurate (we did get a little lost on one of occasion but it helps if you pay attention to the booklet). Marco (team organiser in Mestro) was very informative and offered support if needed along the way. (We didn’t need it but good to know it was there). Thought the bikes were a little heavy but a small consideration given it was an ‘easy’ ride. Scenery was amazing, as were the smaller towns we past through.

Bikes were very good and service system efficient. Maps were too complicated to follow easily and very difficult for non German speakers. Free vouchers were very good and well chosen	Lovely area and lovel scenery	Many thanks for the review. I'm sorry you found the english guide book difficult to use, it was recently updated and we've actually been encouraged by the positive feedback we've been getting. We believe part of the problem stems from the fact that the Danube Cycle Path offers options on either river bank for most of the way through Austria. The guide book describes both options for each section and this can confuse people sometimes. We suggest reading both options thoroughly the night before and then opting for the north or south bank route, whichever appeals most.	3	5	4.00	5c08cf33e4b0cfd3dd112bd9	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5be2ab86e4b05386aa0fb217/customer-review-lovely-experience-ruined-by-complicated-maps

Made friends with some lovely people. As for the boat itself:-most of the staff were very friendly; good service. However, our bedroom was less comfortable than expected, noisy, air con smelt of tobacco smoke? (maybe we were unlucky). Also felt avg price of €25 for a bottle of wine was quite expensive.	Thank you for the review and we are glad you loved most aspects of your holiday. All rooms on board are non-smoking so we can only assume someone was smoking on-deck near the air-intake.

At Baglio La Luna, (first 2 nights) the information about 2 of our group being vegetarians had not been passed on, and the overall standard of the food was rather basic.  In addition, due to communciation problems, we did not realise that coffee was not included in the evening meal, or that the bottles of wine we ordered would be so expensive  (poor packed lunch provided) .  The Hotel at Marsala was a 45 minute walk into the Town centre and did not serve food the evening we were there.<br /><br />The bikes were very good. The route was easy to follow, just a couple of confusing bits, which we resolved quickly.  Great scenery and a fairly well conceived route, but with some boring / unattractive bits. The amount of rubbish dumped at the roadside is sadly distracting. Drivers on the whole reasonably behaved but they do come close to the bikes.<br /><br />Eating out was excellent all over the island<br /><br />We will definitely consider Flexi treks for future  holidays	Thank you for the comprehensive review and apologies for the breakdown in communication with the first hotel regarding the vegetarians.

Only reasons for 4 starts not 5 was the route through to Cassis on Day 6; had to negotiate very busy and complicated route crossing the motorway, multiple roundabouts and junctions.

The roads were quiet, to the point of almost being empty. The scenery beautiful. The town's full of architectural and historic interest. The days weren't too long but could be supplemented with the wealth of historic buildings and wildlife to view. Accommodation was quite outstanding and very good value. It would be insane not to take the half-board option as the catering was if an extremely high standard, again, at an exceptionally good price. Bear in mind that the ride is at modest and altitude and although warm/hot in summer, it can be chilly in the spring and autumn. We were glad of long trousers which we wore in the sun, in late October. Great holiday, highly recommended.

The quality of the accommodation was excellent (we paid for the posh option) with really delightful  characterful hotels - small, local, fun, quiet, welcoming and comfortable - the kind of places you could never find without local knowledge.   Bag transfer was seamless - bags were always there waiting for us. and the downloadable routes on my smart phone worked brilliantly and took all the hassle out of finding the way. Distances were perfect for a family of four with 13 and 16 year old in tow. I would strongly recommend Flexitreks and support from the team was really outstanding - very personal and much appreciated<br /><br />Couple of points - the two evening meals weren't great and I'd probably go with local recommendations next time. This does not detract from the accommodation which was vastly beyond expectations - you can really book with confidence that you will be staying in some stunning hotels -; the breakfasts were all pretty good btw.  Regarding the routes - I know you're constrained by what bikes people have but I wondered if more of the Camino could have been used with 'mountain bike' options to reduce the main road usage a bit more. Finally needing a lift back to the starting hotel was arranged very well by the team, but was a bespoke extra but we can't be the only people who need a lift back to their cars -maybe this could be a routinely available option - but thanks for arranging it so well - worked perfectly.

I know Ally has been in contact with you directly about this but our local supplier has reiterated that if you had contacted them during your holiday they would have changed the bikes out for you without delay. <br />\\n<br />\\nWe endeavor to use tried and tested, good quality properties on these routes but make no guarantees about them always being centrally located - this is because we need to work with hotels that can offer adequate on-site bike storage - something that's not always available in centrally located hotels where space is often at a premium.	4	3	3.50	5bf4b415e4b0e3c31a85be41	https://www.feefo.com/en_GB/reviews/flexitreks/5ba20f35e4b03463cdebff34/customer-review-

From Polegate, follow the delightful Cuckoo trail, a disused railway route, north as far as the village of Heathfield and then switch to quiet lanes - with a few hilly sections - to the tiny village of Groombridge.

Take a stroll around the narrow lanes or adjourn to the beach for a refreshing swim. In the afternoon you continue south along the coast to the town of Poreč where you stop for the night.

Although they call this a museum it is in fact a small town with authentic and well-preserved architecture that will help you appreciate what the Netherlands was like in a bygone era. There are windmills, a wooden shoe workshop and yes, a cheese farm as well as some tiny museums. You can walk around freely, perhaps sampling some of the local food on offer.

About 8 kms further along the lake-shore you board a ferry at Immenstaad for a short cruise to the university town of Friedrichshafen where you will spend the night. We highly recommend a visit to the fascinating Zeppelin Museum that pays tribute to local inventor, Ferdinand von Zeppelin and his groundbreaking airships.	3	public	85	455
641	Friedrichshafen - Lindau, 19 miles/30 kms	Today's ride leads you through small villages and towns that line the northern shoreline. You'll pass marinas, crossing small rivers that feed into the lake. Finally, towards the eastern end of the lake you will reach Lindau, a well preserved medieval town on a small island. You'll spend the night in this atmospheric little place.

642	Lindau - Rorschach/Arbon, 25 miles/40 kms	By now you will have found your cycling legs so the 25 miles from Lindau around the eastern end of the lake to Rorschach/Arbon shouldn't be too taxing - its all pretty flat anyway. In Bregenz, why not have break from cycling and take the cable car up to the Pfaender Mountain for a fantastic view over the lake. Near the town of Hard you cross over the Rhine River flowing into the lake from the Swiss Alps. This delta wetland area is a protected nature reserve and home to many different bird species.

1625	Northern Tour: South-west Fiesland, 26-33 miles/43-55 kms	The day starts with a breakfast cruise across the IJssel Lake to the province of Friesland. The IJssel Lake was created in 1932 when a 20 mile breakwater was built between the provinces of North Holland and Friesland. Occupying 1100 km², it is the largest freshwater lake in western Europe. The boat moors in the small port of Stavoren and after disembarking you can choose between a long and a short ride or a combination of the two.

From here you follow the cycle path along the lake a little further before pedalling out along the breakwater to the former island of Marken. Stroll around the little port, perhaps stopping for lunch or a coffee, before heading out to the lonely lighthouse located at the island's eastern tip. You then enjoy a leisurely ride back into Amsterdam along canal-side cycle paths for a last night aboard the Angela Esmee moored close to the city-centre. Why not visit the floating flower market, the Anne Frank Museum or simply wander the atmospheric streets, perhaps stopping at one of the many street cafes for a glass of beer or wine?	14	public	161	455

1563	Costa Teguise – Haria, 22-33 miles/ 34-52 kms	Your cycling tour starts in earnest today and the route leads you north into the least developed region of the island. Impressive, extinct volcanoes line the quiet road, a reminder that these islands are relatively new in geological terms. After 12kms you reach the small village of Guatiza. The cacti plantations you see here support the cochineal insect from which a natural red dye is derived. You may also choose to stop and visit the Cactus Garden, a beautiful botanical amphitheatre designed by Lanzarote's most famous son, the artist and architect, Cesar Manrique.\n\nAfter passing through the quaint, white fishing villages of Arrieta and Punta Mujeres you enter the Corona Badlands. The wild, untamed landscape around you is only 5000 years old and was created by a massive eruption of Mount Corona - the brooding volcano to your left. The eruption created a 10 km long lava tube which can be visited today and descends from the volcano and out into the sea.\n\nIf you've opted for the shorter cycling route then from here you will shortly turn inland to the village of Haria - your overnight stop. If you are up for more adventure then continue cycling along the wild and beautiful north east coast to the isolated village of Orzola at the northern tip of the island. Here you turn inland and begin an ascent along a quiet winding road that offers ever more impressive sea views to your left. At the t-junction you have a choice, do you turn left and descend, with a couple of minor climbs to Haria or do you turn right and take on the strenuous climb to the Mirador del Rio (River Lookout) 448 meters above sea level? The author recommends the latter as the views really are breathtaking across the strait to neighbouring La Graciosa and you can also visit one of Cesar Manrique's most impressive creations, a balustrade cafe and viewing platform built into the lava.\n\nFrom the Mirador you have an exhilarating and scenic descent along the ridge-line looking down at the wild west coast. The final section of the ride leads you inland through a peaceful and very green part of the island to the village of Haria where you stop for the night.	2	public	158	1576
1704	Prague – Melnik, 33 miles/52 kms	Your first day of cycling takes you to the charming town of Menik, which lies at the confluence of the Vlatva and Elbe Rivers.

1703	Melnik – Litomerice, 31 miles/50 kms	Leave Melnik and cycle on along the Elbe River. Shortly after passing the pleasant riverside town of Roundnice nad Labem we recommend making a small detour to visit Terezin an old military fortress that was used as a concentration camp during WWII. Afterwards it's only a short ride to the charming town of Litomerice where you will overnight. Here you have an array of Gothic, Baroque and Renaissance buildings to admire. We think the local wine in this region is very good and we highly recommend  a visit to one of the many convivial bars or restaurants to form your own opinion.	3	public	166	1565
1702	Litomerice – Decin, 36 miles/58 kms	Your route takes you past the Gothic castle of Strekov perched on a 100 meter cliff overlooking the river and on to Decin for the evening.  The route offers nice views of the wooded hillsides sweeping down to the river. We recommend a visit to the castle, one of the largest in the country, to admire its architecture and design. Afterwards perhaps take time to walk around the Rose gardens to enjoy wonderful views over the town.	4	public	166	2184
1701	Decin – Bad Schandau, 22 miles/35 kms	A short cycle ride today as you cross into Germany. The scenery is quite unique – see the impressive sandstone mountains of this region, now a national park. Arrive into the spa town of Bad Schandau right on the banks of the Elbe and at the mouth of a lovely forested valley.	5	public	166	2189
1700	Bad Schandau – Dresden, 25 miles/40 kms	Today's ride continues along the Elbe River through riverside meadows to the city of Dresden often referred to as the Florence of the Elbe. In 1945 Dresden was bombed relentlessly and this once architecturally stunning city was all but destroyed. After much restoration work many of the city's wonderful baroque buildings and  fine art are again on display. The &quot;Frauenkirche&quot; or &quot;Church of Our Lady&quot; is a prime example of this, having been completely restored from a pile of rubble to her original baroque splendour.	6	public	166	2192
1718	Resia Pass – Silandro, 31 miles/50 kms	After breakfast you are picked up and transferred by van with your bikes to the top of the Resia Pass (German Reschen Pass) in the Venosta Valley. The scenic journey takes about 1 hour 45 minutes and you disembark in the village of Resia (1500m) which enjoys a stunning location at the northern end of Resia Lake surrounded by picturesque alpine meadows and granite peaks. The lake is actually artificial and was created just after World War II immersing some local villages. Today's ride really is special as you'll be pedalling along the peaceful Adige Cycle Path beside the babbling Adige River, enjoying jaw-dropping alpine vistas all the way. Because you've started at the top of the pass the cycling is predominantly downhill and in our opinion leisure cycling really doesn't get much better than this. The gorgeous natural scenery is interrupted only by charming alpine villages such as Burgeis, Malles and Sluderno. All too soon, you arrive at your overnight stop in the pretty town of Silandro.	2	public	167	2373
1564	Haria - Finca La Florida, 19-27 miles/29-43 kms	After breakfast you leave Haria, following the road to the head of the Malpaso valley. The gentle ascent affords fabulous views back across the palm trees to Haria. After a final, steep but thankfully short section you arrive at another Mirador (viewpoint) where you may be tempted to stop for coffee and doughnuts whilst drinking in the fabulous view.\n\nA narrow lane leads you along a ridge to the isolated chapel of Nuestra Senora de las Nieves. Park the bikes and walk over to the cliff edge for a truly spectacular view of Famara beach some  600 meters below! You've earned it so it's now time to enjoy a wonderful long descent down to the town of Teguise. Once the island's capital, the town is a warren of winding streets and alleyways, a good place for a lunch break.\n\nIf you opt for the shorter route today then from Teguise you'll head west, directly to Finca La Florida. Otherwise, the descent continues to the village of Nazaret where you can stop to visit another of\n\nCesar Manrique's creations, an amazing house and garden that was once the home of actor Omar Sharif. A little further downhill you come to Tahiche where it is possible to visit Manrique's own, rather amazing house and museum built into an old lava flow.\n\nThe route then heads out across open, level countryside to the sleepy town of San Bartolome, and then into the La Geria wine region. The vineyards here are rather unique as each vine sits in it's own little, ash-covered hollow, protecting it from wind and aiding moisture collection. You may choose to stop at the El Grifo winery to taste and possibly buy some of the local wares before covering the last couple of kilometers to Finca La Florida. Settle into your comfortable hotel which will be your home for the next two nights.	3	public	158	1565
1565	Famara Roundtrip, 32 miles/50 kms	Today's ride is an optional, circular route to the north shore of the island so if you prefer you can stay at the hotel and enjoy the hotel pool and tennis courts. If you opt for the ride then you'll head first towards Teguise before branching off and heading north across a wide plain that bisects the island. The good road and level terrain invite you to push yourself towards the distant coastline.\n\nBefore long you reach the fishing village of Famara with it's sensational beach at the foot of the towering Famara Cliffs. Seafood lovers may be tempted to enjoy a leisurely lunch at a waterfront restaurant while others may be drawn to the 3km long sandy beach.\n\nLeaving Famara you cycle past Club La Santa, a sports resort with an impressive array of facilities that attract athletes from all over Europe. As you pedal through this region you are likely to be passed by all sorts of athletic types with all the latest cycling gear, including hi-spec triathlon bikes with aerobars - don't be intimidated!\n\nThe route then heads back inland on a gentle ascent towards Tinajo. In Tiagua you can visit a farmhouse/museum showing how islanders lived over 150 years ago. A little further on, near the village of Tao, you'll see a very impressive volcanic crater where ash is extracted to service the unique agricultural techniques used on the island.\n\nThe final stretch of the ride leads you through the island's wine growing region back to Finca La Florida for a second night in this pleasant hotel.	4	public	158	2184
1566	Finca La Florida - Playa Blanca, 30-37 miles/47-58 kms	Today's ride leads you through one of the most fascinating volcanic landscapes in the world.\n\nA beautifully smooth ribbon of black tarmac guides you into the Natural Park of the Volcanoes. This extensive region is the site of some relatively recent and prolonged volcanic eruptions that devastated the island and its inhabitants between 1730 and 1824.\n\nAfter a few kilometers of cycling through this virgin volcanic landscape you arrive at the turn-off  for the Timanfaya National Park. If you decide to enter the €9 entrance fee includes a very informative and interesting 30 minute guided coach tour through the park itself. You'll also see demonstrations showing just how hot the ground beneath your feet still is!\n\nAfter leaving Timanfaya, a short ascent is followed by a long and exhilarating descent out of the park to the town of Yaiza where you have a choice. Do you continue straight on to Playa Blanca, the short option, or turn right and head out to the coast to the fishing village of El Golfo? If you opt for the longer option you can stop to marvel at the impressive crater at the southern edge of the village that is being besieged by the Atlantic. El Golfo is charming little village, famous for its huge choice of waterfront seafood restaurants and an ideal place for a prolonged lunch break.\n\nAn exceptionally smooth road leads you through the tortured lava fields along the south coast towards Playa Blanca. It's worth stopping off at Los Hervideros (the boiling pots) to peer down at the foaming ocean through holes and fissures in the lava rock. Playa Blanca, a pleasant resort town at the southern tip of Lanzarote will be your home for the next two nights.	5	public	158	2189
1706	Cottbus - Spree Forest, 37 miles/59 kms	Today's ride leads you into the Spree Forest. A tranquil ride along idyllic cycle paths and quiet country lanes leads you through open farmland and forest to the town of Lübbenau. We highly recommend taking a break here to explore the maze of tree-lined waterways that start at the town's eastern perimeter. A short boat trip allows you to admire the delightful wooden houses of Lehde nestled in their idyllic settings along the riverbank. Afterwards mount-up again for an enjoyable and relaxing ride ride along the riverbank to the pleasant town of Lübben where you will stop for the night.	8	public	166	124

If you opt for the longer option you'll start cycling from Vianen along the River Lek to Schoonhoven. Alternatively, you can stay on board and let the Magnifique deliver you to Schoonhoven without turning a pedal. Schoonhoven is also known as Silver City due to the number of silversmiths who call the town home. Make time to peruse the many silver shops as well as the very interesting Silver Museum. The route then continues through the Alblasserwaard polder, one of the original land reclamations, to Alblasserdam itself where we catch a waterbus the short distance to Dordrecht. The Magnifique remains moored in Dordrecht, one of Holland's oldest cities, overnight and after dinner we are invited to accompany the guide on a short stroll through the old city centre.	4	public	173	1857
1806	Dordrecht - Alblasserdam - Kinderdijk - Gouda, 19 miles/30 kms	After breakfast we return to Alblasserdam by waterbus and cycle the short distance to Kinderdijk, one of the most famous sights in Holland.This impressive collection of 19 windmills were originally built to pump the Alblasserwaard polder dry. Today, a modern pump does most of the hard work but the windmills are still fully functioning and all but one have resident families living inside. The unoccupied windmill is a museum which you are welcome to explore during your visit. After an easy ride northwards along rural cycle paths we arrive in Gouda, the cheese and candle capital of Holland where the Magnifique is waiting for us. You'll enjoy exploring this beautiful old town in particular the old market square with its ornate Cheese Weighing House. The ship's galley is closed this evening so you are free to make your own arrangements for dinner in one of the many fabulous local restaurants.	5	public	173	1848
1808	Gouda - Leiden - Oude Wettering, 25 - 34 miles/40 - 54 kms	Today you can once again choose between a longer and a shorter route. Both options will showcase what is known as the Green Heart of Holland - green meadows as far as the eye can see, bordered by narrow canals and tiny lakes. A network of cycle paths guides us through this peaceful scenery with the longer option veering west to take in the town of Leiden, birthplace of Rembrandt and home to the oldest university in Holland. Both routes finish in the small village of Oude Wettering where the Magnifique remains moored for the night.	6	public	173	1858
1810	Oude Wettering - Ouderkerkaan de Amstel - Amsterdam, 15 - 27 miles/23 - 43 kms	Our last day of cycling leads us back to Amsterdam along the famous Amstel River. Once again you can opt to stay on board for a section of the route, thereby shortening the distance you have to cycle. Along the way we'll stop at a cheese farm where you'll have the opportunity to taste and even buy some lovely local cheese. After riding through a lovely forested area you cycle back into the centre of Amsterdam for a final night aboard the Magnifique at her home mooring. Ater dinner there is an opportunity to join a boat tour through the canals of old Amsterdam - a fitting finale to a great trip!	7	public	173	1853

This photogenic village is perched on the world’s largest ochre deposit and its houses are all painted varying hues of yellow orange and red. The bright buildings sandwiched between an azure blue sky and a verdant tree clad hillside make quite a sight. Just a few kilometrs further west you arrive in Gordes, one of the jewels in the Luberon’s crown and often mentioned in lists of France’s most beautiful villages. Ascend the winding, spiralling streets past the lovely old stone houses to the fortified castle at the top. Sit in the shaded square and drink in the atmosphere along with some light refreshment perhaps? Leave Gordes and cycle through a pine and cedar forest to L’Isle sur la Sorgue. So named because it is completely encircled by the Sorgue River, this beautiful old town will be your home for the next two nights. Check in to you hotel and then take stroll through the winding, medieval streets of the old town and along the river bank.\n\nMarket day in Rousillon: Tues\nMarket day in Gordes: Tues\nMarket day in Isle sue la Sorgue: Wed &amp; Sun	6	public	152	2192
1466	Circular ride to Pernes les Fontaines and Venasque, 24 miles/39 kms	Your final day in the saddle leads you north along pleasant backroads lined with cypress trees and ancient farmhouses. The pretty village of Pernes les Fontaines lives up to its name with no less than 40 fountains dotted about its narrow streets. From here the route leads you through the Monts de Vaucluse region, past a succession of gorgeous little villages all perched on bluffs overlooking the surrounding provencale countryside. The medieval village of Venasque is sure to be a highlight of the day even though the climb up to it will get the blood pumping. At the end of the day a pleasant descent through pine forests back to Isle sur la Sorgue brings your cycling adventure in Provence to an end. Celebrate your achievement with a meal in one of the town’s many fine restaurants.	7	public	152	2193

It's easy to shorten the route if you like, so take your time and stop whenever the mood grabs you. At the end of the day you'll return to La Rochelle for a second night.</p>	2	public	180	1861
1720	Bolzano – Trento, 41-44 miles/65-70 kms	Today there are two route options to choose from. The easiest and most direct route leads you south along the lower Adige valley beside the river which is bigger now, swollen by its confluence with the Eisack River at Bolzano. The second, slightly longer option includes a couple of short climbs but the payoff is a ride through the stunning Caladaro Valley to Lake Caldaro. The lake is one of the warmest in the alps and just perfect for a swim if the weather is hot. The two routes converge in the Adige Valley near the town of Ora from where you continue your journey south.  For centuries this wide fertile valley has been one of the primary north-south trading routes through the alps and the scenery is spectacular. Tiny, white alpine villages, perched on the green mountainsides on either side of the valley, are overlooked by towering granite peaks. The easy, level cycle path sticks resolutely to the valley floor leading you through the small pleasant villages of Ora, Egna and Salomo before arriving at Trento, today’s destination.  Trento has a long and colourful history, thanks to its strategic position on one of the Alps’ main passes. Head for the picturesque medieval city centre to absorb the atmosphere and learn more.	5	public	167	2189
1721	Trento - Lake Garda, 32 miles/50kms (plus ferry journey if you opt for the 7 night version)	Leaving Trento you continue down the valley to Rovereto where you leave the Adige River and cycle up a ridge to escape the valley. The climb is rewarded with an exhilarating freewheel down to the northern shoreline of stunning Lake Garda.\n\nIf you opt for the 6 night version of this tour then your holiday will finish with a night in one of the charming towns on Lake Garda's north shore. If you choose the the 7 night version then you'll enjoy a wonderful ferry ride the entire length of the Lake to Peschiera on the southern shore. The scenery from the boat is spectacular with sheer limestone cliffs and tree-lined hillsides plunging down into the deep blue lake. Pretty villages line the shore and brightly coloured windsurfing sails flit to and fro across the lake’s surface. Disembark in Peschiera and make your way to your nearby hotel.	6	public	167	2192
1723	OPTION 1 Desenzano/Peschiera - Verona, 37-22 miles/60-35kms	Leave Lake Garda behind and cycle eastwards through open countryside to the Roman city of Verona. Shakespeare chose the beautiful city as the setting for Romeo and Juliet and you can visit Casa di Giulietta, purported to be the location of the famous balcony scene. The wonderful Arena, a crumbling Roman amphitheatre still hosts lavish productions today and you may wish to time your arrival to coincide with a particular performance – use this link to research further but be sure to book in advance as most performances are sold out months in advance. Ascend the Lamberti tower for a great view over the city, enjoy an ice cream in the buzzing Piazza Bra and stroll through the atmospheric old town exploring the maze-like streets.	7	public	167	2193
1815	Persenbeug - Krems, 37 miles/59 kms	Today's ride is a real treat and it's worth starting early as you'll probably want to to stop and look around some of the charming villages and towns  along the way.\n\nShortly after starting out you'll see a lovely church up on the hillside to your left. This is the Pilgrimage Church of Maria Taferl from where, following a bit of a climb, you can enjoy marvellous views along the Danube Valley. In the distance you can just make out the Benedictine Monastery at Melk. On arrival in Melk we recommend a walk up to the 18th Century Monastery where you can visit an impressive library with countless medieval manuscripts as well enjoy more superb views along the river.\n\nThe next section of today's ride is considered by many to be amongst the most beautiful sections of the whole river  - the Wachau Valley. Romantic castles and palaces perch on strategic bluffs overlooking terraced vineyards and orchards that cascade down to charming wine villages such as Spitz, Weißkirchen and Dürnstein. Beautiful old taverns and Inns invite you to stop and enjoy hearty, Wachau hospitality before riding on along the river to Krems. The people in this region are justly proud of their wine so if you abstained during the day be sure to visit one of the many wine cellars in Krems to sample the fine local product.	5	public	174	1848
1818	Passau – Danube Loop, 27 miles/43 kms	Your first day’s ride follows the Upper Danube Valley to Schlögen on the famous Danube Loop, where the mighty river makes a 180 degree turn. On the way you will ride ride through Enghartszell, a small riverside village.

1821	Vienna - Free day to explore	Today is your free day to explore Vienna. Visit Schönbrunn Palace, St. Stephen’s Cathedral, and the Imperial Palace. You may also want to take in the ‘Riesenrad’, the giant ferris wheel, made famous in the 1949 film, ‘The Third Man’. No trip to Vienna would be complete without enjoying a coffee and cake in one of the city’s elegant coffee houses. In the evening we highly recommend trying the local speciality - Wienerschnitzel. This pan-fried breaded pork cutlet has become popular around the world but this is where it was born.	7	public	174	1853
1822	Vienna - Bratislava, 42 miles/68 kms	Shortly after leaving the hustle and bustle of Vienna you enter a very different world, cycling through a riverside nature reserve full of diverse flora and fauna. The city suddenly seems a million miles away with the peace and quiet only interrupted by chattering birds. The Romans left their mark around here and we highly recommend stopping at the Carnuntum archaeological park just before the spa town of Bad Deutsch-Altenburg. Therafter you cycle across the border into Slovakia and follow the riverbank to the country’s charming capital, Bratislava. The medieval town at the city’s heart actually feels more like a large village than a city and the attractive flag-stoned streets are a delight to explore on foot or by bike. Other must-sees include the Castle, which offers fantastic views from its high vantage point and St Martin’s Cathedral, the city’s oldest church. You'll spend the night in this enchanting city	8	public	174	2351
1823	Bratislava - Mosonmagyaróvàr, 28 miles/45 kms	Today you have a lovely ride along an idyllic cycle path beside the river. The Danube broadens considerably just after Bratislava and resembles a lake more than a river. It also marks the border between Hungary (southern bank) and Slovakia (Northern bank).  Nature holds sway here and the only sounds are your tyres on the tarmac and birdsong. After a while you leave the river and head south to pleasant old town of Mosonmagyaróvàr where you will stop for the night.	9	public	174	2347
1824	Mosonmagyaróvàr - Györ - Komárno, 40 miles/64 kms (plus 27 minute train ride)	After breakfast, head for the local train station and board a train for the town of Györ about half an hour down the track (trains depart every hour). From Györ, a lovely old town worthy of a look round, you pedal north to rejoin the idyllic cycle path that follows the Danube River. The raised embankment provides a nice platform from which you can admire the surrounding countryside and river views as you head east. Your destination today is the town of Komárom or Komárno. This fortress town has two names as it straddles the river and is therefore part Slovak and part Hungarian.	10	public	174	2271
1825	Komárno - Visegrád, 43 miles/69 kms	The route continues along the embankment cycle path. After a few kilometres you might want to stop at the the Roman fort Kelemantia. From there you pedal on through quiet farming villages before arriving in the city of Esztergom, famous for its imposing basilica, the largest in Hungary. The town also has a lovely town square which could be a good place for a coffee break.\n\nA little further on, after rounding a particularly beautiful bend in the river you arrive in the pleasant little town of Visegrád where you will spend the night.	11	public	174	2270

This well known and popular cycle path leads you through level countryside on paths and quiet lanes through small Lombardian towns and villages to the historic and beautiful Renaissance city of Mantova. The narrow flag-stoned streets of the medieval old town are a delight to explore on foot or by bike. The Gonzaga family, who ruled Mantova for nearly four centuries, left the city with some amazing architectural masterpieces. Visit Piazza Sordello which forms the heart of the city; Palazzo Ducale with its huge set of frescoes and of course the Duomo, which retains the Romanesque bell-tower form the 11th century. If history is not your thing you can simply enjoy the bustling atmosphere of the medieval town centre, perhaps toasting completion of your odyssey with a glass of something cool and tasty!	7	public	167	124
609	Passau - Engelhartszell	Upon arrival in Passau make your way to your riverboat where boarding commences at 5pm. Settle into your cabin and explore the ship before enjoying a welcome cocktail with your fellow passengers and hearing more about the coming week from the captain and crew. If you arrive early, Passau is a charming town with plenty to see and do. It is the point at which the Danube, Inn and Ilz rivers all meet so there are plenty of river banks to stroll along but we also recommend making the climb to Veste Oberhaus, a medieval fortress and museum that offers a fantastic, panoramic view of the town and surrounding countryside. At 7pm the crew cast off for a dinner cruise downstream to the village of Engelhartszell where we moor for the night.	1	public	82	2389

Take the time to sample the town’s namesake digestive brandy, which is exported all over the world.	2	public	20	2300
1212	Arrive Matera	Your cycling holiday starts in one of the oldest settlements in Italy, Matera. After arrival you are free to relax or explore as your welcome briefing is scheduled for approximately 8.30 am tomorrow morning. Since paleolithic times man has lived here in dwellings dug into the honey-coloured soft stone of the surrounding hillside. Over centuries more houses were added above and below each other, connected by a maze-like network of stairways and exterior corridors. Looking across the valley, the town looks like a huge human rabbit warren. It's extremely picturesque and is protected as a world heritage site but not so long ago its inhabitants were amongst the poorest in Italy, living without running water or electricity. You'll spend the night in this atmospheric town before starting your cycling adventure in the morning.	1	public	136	\N
1213	Matera - Alberobello, 44 miles/70 kms	Leave Matera and set off on your bike across a rural plain. The land is quite arid here, Basilicata is one of the driest regions in Italy and seas of wheatfields are punctuated with just a few olive groves. After a while you pass from Basilicata, the instep of Italy, into Puglia, the heel, and immediately the landscape becomes greener. Your route is lined with lush meadows and ancient olive groves contained by picturesque dry stone walls. Eventually you arrive in Alberobello, a pretty town famous for the preponderance of 'Trulli' houses within its confines. These charming, circular stone dwellings were designed to keep the occupants cool during the long hot summers and very effective they are too - as you will learn for yourself as tonight you will stay in your very own Trullo.	2	public	136	1852
1214	: Alberobello - Ostuni, 28 miles/45 kms	Today's ride leads you through the Valle d’Itria dotted with small hamlets and pretty vineyards.

1215	Ostuni – Lecce – Gallipoli, 44 miles/70 kms by train 32 miles/50 kms by bike	The day starts with a train journey of about 70km, with your bike, to the town of Lecce. You'll spend more time here in three days time but for now you mount up and ride south along quiet, winding lanes lined with gnarled old olive groves and ancient stone walls. This peaceful and enjoyable ride ends at the fortified port town of Gallipoli. The town occupies a strategic position and has a long history of repelling attackers as well as being overrun. A visit to the impressive fortress will provide you with more details on its violent past. The narrow winding streets of the old town have a Moorish feel to them and are a delight to explore in the evening.	4	public	136	1857
1216	Gallipoli – Santa Maria di Leuca, 32 miles/50 kms	Continue south along the Ionian coastline, the route passes numerous idyllic beaches so it's a good idea to have your swim stuff packed in your pannier today. After this lovely coastal ride you arrive in the small town of Santa Maria di Leuca. The town marks the point where the Ionian and Adriatic seas meet and has that lovely end-of-the-earth, remoteness about it. This is probably why it has attracted quite an eccentric population many of whom live in the numerous, quirky but luxurious villas that abound here. Spend the night in this pleasant little town.	5	public	136	1848

The grand facades and whimsical turrets of the old limestone buildings in the historical centre create a unique atmosphere and a stroll around the narrow, winding streets is definitely time well-spent.

You could also stop off at the Zinzulusa Cave, a stunning Grotto with clear turquoise waters and/or the spa town of Santa Cesarea, known for its sulphurous mineral springs and mud therapy treatments. Otranto itself is an enchanting old town and the waterfront promenade is the perfect place to enjoy a delicious meal after the day’s activities.	6	public	136	1861
1218	Otranto – Lecce, 35 miles/55 kms	Your last day of cycling takes you further along the coast to Torre dell’Orso – a great place for a swim by the way – and then inland to the Baroque city of Lecce. The city has been dubbed the Florence of the South and makes a lovely finale to the cycling holiday. Narrow little streets suddenly open up to reveal baroque treasures seething with detail, like the incredible Basilica di Santa Croce. Historically, Lecce was always the powerhouse of Puglia and this is evident in its opulent and ornate architecture. Perhaps celebrate your achievement with a nice meal in one of the town’s many restaurants.	7	public	136	1851

737	Giardini Naxos – Acireale, 23 miles/37 kms	It’s your final day of riding and you’ll round off your Sicilian adventure with a largely flat route along the Ionian coast. There’s a short but not overly demanding uphill stretch at the end but it’s well worth it as you’ll be arriving at the attractive historic city of Acireale, your final destination.	7	public	95	55
587	Arrive Dijon	Upon arrival make your way to your hotel. After check-in you are free to relax or explore the city. Dijon is a vibrant, walkable city with a wealth of great shops, restaurants and bars and a really welcoming vibe to it. There are many museums, churches and traditional buildings to discover including the Palais des Ducs and the church of Notre Dame. We suggest you follow the ‘Owl’s Trail’ which highlights 22 key points of interest in the city. Legend has it that if you want some good luck you need to find the tiny stone sculpture of the owl at the Notre Dame church - touch it with your left hand and make a wish!	1	public	80	\N
588	Dijon – Vougeot, 13 miles/20 kms	Leaving Dijon behind, you navigate your way out of the city and cycle into the countryside where the Route de Grands Crus begins. Arrive into the region of Gevrey Chambertin, the largest appellation in Côte de Nuits, Pinot Noir country, and where you find some of France’s most famous wines including Vosne-Romanée, Fixin, Chambertin-clos-de-Bèze, Flagey-Echézeaux, Vougeot, Richebourg. Cycle on through the wine regions of Morey Saint Denis, Chambolle-Musigny and Vougeot with vineyards all along the way on either side of you offering breathtaking scenery and crisp, fresh air!\n\nTime permitting we highly recommend stopping for a leisurely lunch at Chez Guy, a wonderful restaurant in the charming village of Gevrey-Chambertin before cycling the last 6 kilometers to your overnight stay in the village of Vougeot.	2	public	80	353
589	Vougeot – Beaune, 13 miles/25 kms	This morning you will cycle through the delightful village of Nuit St Georges and then on to the the small city of Beaune, the Capital of the Burgundy wine lands. There is plenty to see and do here. On a single ticket you can visit the fine arts museum as well as the rather good wine museum. The famous Hospices de Beaune, a hospital built in the 15th century to look after Beaune’s poor and sick is also very interesting as is the Athénaeum, a bookshop, shop and wine cellar dedicated to the art of wine making. A tour of the extensive Patriarche Wine Cellars concludes with an opportunity to taste the product.\n\nWe also recommend a visit to La Moutarderie, a mustard manufacturer run by the Fallot family. You can learn how mustard was made and developed throughout the years. There is also a fabulous shop where you can sample and buy a huge variety of delicious mustards.	3	public	80	455
590	Beaune – Chagny - Chassey Le Camp, 16 miles/25 kms	Today is a special day as you will be cycling through some of Burgundy’s best-known wine-making areas including Pommard, Meursault, and Puligny-Montrachet. There are quite a few restaurants to choose from in Meursault. One of our favourites is the Hotel/Bar du Centre on Rue de Lattre de Tassigny. From the outside you don’t actually see the nice, leafy patio area at the back, but we do recommend it for lunch. Some of the finest mellow dry white wines in France come from Meursault. Further on, you may wish to stop by Montrachet, which produces what many consider to be the best dry wine in the world! Finally you arrive in the provincial market town of Chagny - you spend the night in nearby Chassey Le Camp.	4	public	80	516
591	Chagny – Dracy Le Fort, 14 miles/22 kms	Today's route leads you along a very pleasant dedicated cycling path beside the Canal du Centre to the beautiful riverside town of Chalon sur Saone. Take time to explore the narrow streets of this medieval town before cycling on towards the nearby village of Dracy Le Fort where you will overnight. Just before reaching the village you may chose to visit the fascinating Chateau de Germolles which offers a fascinating insight into life in the middle ages.	5	public	80	1182
592	Dracy Le Fort – Cluny, 29 miles/46 kms	We suggest an early start today. Join a traffic-free cycle path and as you cycle along at a gentle pace take in the magnificent countryside dotted with forests and ‘cabottes’, which are traditional stone houses. En-route stop off at Saint Gengoux Le National, a medieval town with a rich heritage and where you will see many historic properties from the sixteenth and seventeenth century. Onwards to Cormatin – be prepared the landscape changes and becomes quite hilly! The village itself has a château, a beautiful castle with splendid gardens, which gives you a real glimpse of 17th century French life. Arrive into the beautiful town of Cluny, which was once a spiritual centre. Make sure you visit the Roman Abbey church, which was once a major pilgrimage site. Time permitting; check out the National Stud Farm adjoining the Abbey property. The farm is used to maintain specific breeds of horses that are unique to France.	6	public	80	1188
593	Cluny – Mâcon, 18 miles/28 kms	The scenery changes a little today as you cycle through the Val Lamartinien with its charming villages and slightly more hilly landscape. The village of Vergisson enjoys a particularly picturesque setting and is thought by many to be one of the most beautiful natural sights in France.	7	public	80	1186

548	Vougeot / Gilly le Cîteaux – Beaune:  17 miles/26 kms	This morning you will cycle through the delightful village of Nuit St Georges and then on to the the small city of Beaune, the Capital of the Burgundy wine lands. There is plenty to see and do here. On a single ticket you can visit the fine arts museum as well as the rather good wine museum. The famous Hospices de Beaune, a hospital built in the 15th century to look after Beaune’s poor and sick is also very interesting as is the Athénaeum, a bookshop, shop and wine cellar dedicated to the art of wine making.

549	Beaune roundtrip, 22 miles/35 kms	A loop tour today as you cycle into the countryside and discover the fairy-tale castle of La Rochepot, overlooking the village. It is a photo opportunity not to be missed - take the back road from St Aubin but be careful of other cyclists who tend to stop quite abruptly at times to take photos! Cycle back to Beaune via the Côte de Beaune vineyards through the best-known winemaking villages such as Puligny-Montrachet, Meursault, Pommard. Your last night is spent in Beaune.	4	public	76	516

658	Astorga - Molinaseca, 30 miles/49 Kms	As you begin your journey today, you follow the Camino as it ascends from the Castilian plains up into the mountains of Leon. As you approach the highest point, you reach the Cruz de Ferro, a stone cairn topped by an iron cross. Over the centuries it has become tradition to lay a stone here, brought from your homeland, as a symbol of something you wish to leave behind - and move forward from. After you have placed your stone and made your wish, cycle onwards where you will be rewarded with stunning vistas as you head towards the town of Molinaseca. Our top tip, if the weather is hot, is to take a refreshing dip in the river, flowing through this town of stone buildings, before you head out to enjoy dinner at one of the many restaurants.	2	public	87	353
659	Molinaseca – O’Cebreiro, 36 miles/58 Kms	Leaving Molinaseca behind, your route takes you through the city of Ponferrada - with its 12th century Knights Templar castle – and through sweeping vineyards, before arriving in the beautiful town of Villafranca - the region’s capital. You can take a short rest here before beginning your climb to the mountaintop town of O’Cebreiro. The climb is long and steep towards the end; however the views looking down the road you have just cycled, into the canyon of vineyards and fertile lands are a worthy reward for your efforts. On arrival in O’Cebreiro you are bound to be mesmerised by its collection of “pallozas” – round, stone houses, with thatched roofs – and also its church, which dates back to the pre-Romanesque period. Don’t miss a visit to the church, which contains a Holy Grail, to which the church bells guided many pilgrims, through the winter mists.	3	public	87	455
661	O ́Cebreiro – Sarria, 28 miles/44 Kms	As you have now arrived in the region of Galicia many aspects of your holiday are about to change; the language is vastly different; the Galician landscape is characterised much more by its hills; and the culture and cuisine change too. You continue in earnest towards your destination for today, Sarria, passing through some lovely scenery of wooded hills and agricultural land. We reccomend lunch in Sarria. The cycling is predominantly downhill and a highlight of the day will be a stop in Samos, home to a beautiful Benedictine monastery. The striking monastery has been a refuge for pilgrims over the centuries and what a delightful area it is to stop and get refreshments. You continue on to Sarria, a city founded under Alfonso IX who reigned from 12th-13th centuries. Because of its links with the Camino de Santiago, the city can boast many medieval structures and we recommend visiting the castle or the Convent of Magdalena. Or alternatively you can while away your time browsing the many antique shops.	4	public	87	516
662	Sarria - Palas de Rei, 30 miles/48 Kms	From Sarria, you begin to see many more like-minded people, travelling the Camino de Santiago, as it is the closest point from which pilgrims can walk the minimum 100 miles to gain their Camino certificate. As you cycle, through forests of oak, birch and chestnut, and lovely rural countryside, many characterful towns and charming villages will be part of the ever-changing scenery. There are considerable climbs coming out of Sarria and a prolonged climb coming out of Portomarin.  Also, be prepared to experience varied types of terrain, as you ride along tree-lined roads, modern pathways, country roads or ancient paths. Palas de Rei is your destination and on arrival, you will find the pilgrim spirit palpable as the hotels and hostels fill with all those who are each on their own journey of discovery.	5	public	87	1182
663	Palas de Rei – Rua, 37 miles/60 Kms	The cycling today includes some small descents and climbs and so it can be slightly hard. You are drawing closer to your target and this is confirmed as you begin to see the clam shell and arrow markers, clearly displayed at the side of the route. The Galician countryside continues as you reach the town of Melide – if you like seafood, don’t miss the opportunity to sample the delicious octupus dishes in the town’s famous “pulperias”. Also take time to visit the Monastery and Hospital of Sancti Spiritus, home to fascinating 15th century frescos that depict St James as the “Moor Slayer”. Another of Melide’s churches, the Church of Santa Maria, has more 12th century frescos on display. Spend the night in the village of Rua, resting in readiness for tomorrow’s finale.	6	public	87	1188
664	Rua - Santiago de Compostela, 17 miles/27 Kms	Your final destination approaches, as your last day of cycling takes you to the, much-revered, Santiago de Compostela and the culmination of your inspiring journey. In order that you can enjoy the city on arrival, the distances you cycle are not great, although there are a few inclines as you approach the “Monte do Gozo” (known as the Hill of Joy). As you catch your first glimpse of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, it takes your breath away. Cycle downhill into the city centre, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in its entirety. The tomb of the Apostle St. James is located within the city’s stunning cathedral. The rest of the day is free to spend as you wish. Don’t forget to also explore the interesting pedestrianised plazas that surround the cathedral, which have their own unique atmosphere.	7	public	87	1186
665	End of trip	Having reached the end of your fascinating journey along this renowned pilgrimage route, it’s time to head for home or your next adventure.	8	public	87	1115
1370	Sérignac sur Garonne - Moissac, 37 miles/60 kms	Today you can look forward to a beautiful and easy ride with many points of interest along the way. The Agen Aqueduct is both impressive and beautiful, consisting of 23 stone arches that carry the canal across the Garonne River. It was opened in 1849 and is quite narrow meaning barges have to wait their turn at either end. Agen itself is a lovely old town and definitely worthy of a wander around and a coffee break. The Canal continuously flirts with the Garonne River and at times you will be cycling along the narrow strip of land that separates the two. Saint Nicholas de Grave marks the confluence of the Garonne and Tarn Rivers and the resulting lake is a well-known bird sanctuary. You spend the night in a 3 star hotel on the banks of the River Tarn in the lovely old town of Moissac.	5	public	146	1848
1371	Moissac - Toulouse, 40 miles/64 kms	Your last day following the Canal de Garonne is a very pleasant one. Pretty, rural villages line the route as you follow the canal south through open countryside towards Toulouse. In the town of Montech you can stop to admire the unique water-slope, an ingenious, some would say overly-complicated, lock-replacement system that moves a wedge of water, complete with barge, up or downhill. After some more idyllic riding in the shade of the canal-side plane trees you arrive in the city of Toulouse. Known as the ‘pink-city’ due to the abundance of rosy-red brick buildings Toulouse is steeped in history and has one of the largest Roman churches in Europe. Alternatively, you could take the tour of the Airbus Factory on the outskirts of town and/or visit Cité de l’Espace, an excellent and informative space museum. Enjoy a celebratory meal on the town’s bustling square before retiring to your centrally located 3 star hotel for a good night’s sleep.	6	public	146	1861
1372	Departure	After breakfast it's time to checkout and head for home or your next adventure. Why not complete the coast to coast journey by following the Canal du Midi from Toulouse to the Mediterranean.	7	public	146	1851

394	96	getting_there	<p>Fly to Bilbao or Santander and fly home from Bilbao.</p>\n<p>The closest airport for arrival is Santander Airport and the most convenient for departure is Bilbao Airport.\n<br />An arrival transfer from either Santander or Bilbao airport is included with the holiday as is a departure transfer to Bilbao at the end of your holiday.\n<br />Important: At the end of the tour, the transfer from Laguardia to Bilbao leaves at <strong>9am.</strong> The journey time is 90 minutes, so, allowing for a 2-hour check in time it is best to book a mid afternoon flight from Bilbao. Another option is to spend an extra night in Bilbao and visit the city and the Guggenheim Museum (Remember the museum is closed on Monday except during the months of July and August when it is open every day).</p>

Most roads are paved and there is very little traffic to contend with.

160	159	itinerary_snippet	This is leisure cycling at its best and while there are some hills to contend with they are never very long and the going is easy on the whole. If you're concerned about the hills then opt for a state-of-the-art e-bike which will bring this tour within reach of anyone with a basic level of fitness.\n\nChoose between guided and self-guided options. If you opt for self-guided option you will be provided with route notes and maps for each day as well as a telephone number should you require assistance during the ride. If you choose the guided option you will cycle in a group (minimum 8, maximum 20) led by an English speaking local guide who knows the area well and will impart information regarding the region's wines, traditions and culture.\n\nThis tour operates in alternate directions each week. The itinerary below describes the route from Libourne to Castets-en-Dorthe. Bear in mind that every other week the tour will start in Castets-en-Dorthe and finish in Libourne so on these occasions the below itinerary should be considered in reverse.
578	159	getting_there	<p>Fly to Bordeaux airport and then catch the number one bus, which departs every 20 minutes, into Bordeaux, alighting at the main train station -  Gare Saint Jean. Alternatively, take the new high-speed rail link, connecting Paris to Bordeaux in just 2 hours!</p>\n<p>Depending on the time of your arrival, you may wish to reserve seats on the bus transfer between Bordeaux's Gare Saint Jean station and the boat which departs at 2pm  (see price panel for prices). If your flight arrival time does not sync with the transfer time then you'll need to make your own way to the boat using the directions below:</p>\n<p><strong>Libourne:</strong>\n<br />Trains depart Gare Saint Jean every 15 minutes for Libourne and the journey time is 25 minutes. Take a short taxi ride (1km) from Libourne station to the river where the boat is moored.</p>\n<p><strong>Castets-en-Dorthe:</strong>\n<br />Trains depart Gare Saint Jean every 30 minutes for Langon and the journey time is about 30 minutes.

35	34	itinerary_snippet	As you would expect from a cycling holiday in this corner of Europe, the going is mainly flat and any inclines are barely discernible. You’ll be cycling along canal towpaths and a network of wonderful, car-free cycle lanes. On the odd occasion when you do take to the road it will be on quiet country roads with very little traffic. The pace is leisurely and well within the abilities of most leisure cyclists.\n\n<strong>The itinerary below describes the route from Amsterdam to Ghent via Bruges however on alternate weeks the tour operates in the reverse direction, from Ghent via Bruges to Amsterdam. The itinerary remains essentially the same but in reverse order. Check the dates and prices tab to see in which direction the tour operates on your preferred start date.</strong>

It is also famous for producing delicious cuisine and some truly sensational wines.<strong> </strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Pedal along quite lanes and paths, past olive groves and vineyards, through the breathtakingly beautiful Umbrian Valley. Hilltop towns beckon from afar and any extra effort required to assail the flanks of these medieval gems is invariably paid back by their simple, timeless charm and wondrous views.</p><p>The many highlights of this classic route include Assisi, birthplace of St Francis, founder of the Franciscan order, Spello, a gorgeous little hilltop town that entrances all who enter and Spoleto, another medieval town with an impressive castle still largely contained within its fortifications.</p><p><img src="https://flexitreks.imgix.net/images/2013/10/25/29.jpg?w=800" /></p><p>Cathedral of San Rufino - Assisi - UmbriaAssisi - Umbria</p><p>You'll also have the opportunity to visit Montefalco, to wonder at the view from the 'Balcony of Umbria', as well as Perugia the provincial capital with its wonderful Piazzas, Renaissance palaces and medieval churches.</p><p>And finally we have to mention the food and wine. If, like us, you appreciate dining well on your cycling holidays then you are in for a real treat. In a country that appreciates food so much, it is impressive to learn that Italians themselves revere this region for the quality of its cuisine. Similarly the local wines, such as Rosso di Montefalco and Sagrantino are also held in very high esteem and are likely to be a memorable element of a wonderful holiday.</p><p>The route adheres to the valley floor for the most part with some slightly hilly sections in parts. Apart from the steeper climbs to Montefalco (which can be avoided) and Assisi this tour is suitable for anyone with an average fitness level.</p><p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-2647191/Antiquity-poppies-wine-A-cycling-holiday-glorious-heartland-Umbria-makes-heady-mix.html" target="_blank"><strong>Read Mail-Online journalist Adian Lowery's account of his experiences on this tour</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>	029-103CIT	1	61	602	live	umbria-classic-cycling-holiday	\N	{7}	{Leisurely}	200	April - October	\N	0	f	70	5.00	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
